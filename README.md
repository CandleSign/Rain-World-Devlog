# Rain-World-Devlog
An archive of the Rain World devlog (https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183) with all messages from JLJac and jamesprimate, and all the embedded images I could find and save.

<h2>Credits!</h2>
- <a href="https://github.com/Enderzilla747">Enderzilla747</a> for their <a href="https://github.com/thalber/rw-devlog-archives/tree/main/endump">archive</a>, without which some images would have been impossible to find.<br>
- pink#3241 for the nightcatsad emote, reconverted into a lost image replacement.<br>
- <a href="https://rainworld.miraheze.org/wiki/User:Cashewww">Cashewww</a> for the wiki theme, which my addiction to the <a href="https://rainworld.miraheze.org/">Rain World wiki</a> brought me to shamelessly replicate.<br>
- And the <a href="https://twitter.com/VideocultMedia">Rain World devs</a> of course! for virtually everything archived here.

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
Although most images are the exact same as the ones initially used in the devlog, some of them could not be found in original quality (or, in one case, were originally too large to fit here). As faithful as this repository aims to be, be aware that it is not always a perfect copy of the original.

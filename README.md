<h2>Credits!</h2>
- <a href="https://github.com/Enderzilla747">Enderzilla747</a> for their <a href="https://github.com/thalber/rw-devlog-archives/tree/main/endump">archive</a>, without which some images would have been impossible to find.<br>
- supermassive_blackhole for the nightcatsad emote, reconverted into a lost image replacement.<br>
- <a href="https://rainworld.miraheze.org/wiki/User:Cashewww">Cashewww</a> for the wiki theme, which my addiction to the <a href="https://rainworld.miraheze.org/">Rain World wiki</a> brought me to shamelessly replicate.<br>
- Anyone who ever dropped by the archive channel/thread with new images or suggestions - thanks a lot for helping find some pretty out-of-the-way ones!<br>
- And the <a href="https://twitter.com/VideocultMedia">Rain World devs</a> of course! for virtually everything archived here.

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
Although most images are the exact same as the ones initially used in the devlog, some of them could not be found in original quality (or, in one case, were originally too large to fit here), and I may also have made mistakes when guessing where some of them could have been used originally. As faithful as this repository aims to be, be aware that it is not always a perfect copy of the original.

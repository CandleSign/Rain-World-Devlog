						<h2>How to use</h2>
						As you may have seen, there are three versions of the devlog:<br>
						- the full version: all posts in a single online document. Although it is the most complete, I would not recommend using it because of the absurd loading times. The two other versions are meant to prevent this.<br>
						- the paged version: separated in 95 pages of 20 posts. You can't use it to search something specific yet but it is the most convenient for casual reading.<br>
						- the downloadable version: like the full version, but offline, which suddenly lowers the loading time to 30 seconds or so. Incredible! My personal favorite, but you need to download all images as well, which represent about 1.3GB. (note: the message links redirect to the paged version, which makes it easy to search a specific message and then send its link to someone else)<br>
						<br>
						Clicking on message headers redirects to the original devlog, in case you want to see their context.<br>
						<br>
						<h2>The project</h2>
						The <a href="https://github.com/CandleSign/Rain-World-Devlog">Rain World Devlog Archive</a> is a fan project which aims to restore the whole Rain World devlog from <a href="https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183" target="_blank">TIGForums</a> with all its missing images, starting with dev posts.<br>
						To briefly explain the process, I downloaded every page (all 367!) and then ran a program that selects the posts from JLJac and jamesprimate, reformats everything, checks whether the images exist or not, and then outputs the different versions of the devlog.<br>
						Finding the images though is what really takes time. Most of them have very thankfully been saved on WayBack Machine, but not all. A lot of the missing ones could be found in Enderzilla's archive, some others in Kickstarter updates, some other scattered, more or less modified, across various forums. But I have probably not found all that could be found yet, and the search needs to go on!<br>
						And when I have time, another step will be to restore non-dev posts without which a lot of context is often lacking. But finding all of their images is likely to take twice as much time, and recovering the lost ones via anything else than WayBack Machine will probably be impossible. I won't be able to restore them fully, but taking the time to restore such an important part of the devlog - advice and feedback, helping shape the game! - needs to be done after all.<br>
						<br>
						<h2>Contact</h2>
						Any question? Any suggestion? Feel free come and talk in the #archive-projects channel of the <a href="https://discord.gg/rainworld">Rain World Discord server</a>, or just DM me (CandleSign#4539).<br>
						Do you have any of the missing images, or do you want to help search? <a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Lost images">Here</a> is a list to check what has not been found yet.<br>
						And finally, if you want to and have some useful knowledge, you can help build the site itself! I'm particularly thinking of implementing a search bar for the paged version, but any improvement is welcome (I'm a web design beginner and the project was originally just intended to help me find messages, so making it helpful to everyone is still largely a work in progress).<br>

						Oh and of course I should write this here too:

It seems to be making the game pretty brutal, but it also opens up for more fun sneaking scenarios such as throwing a rock to trick the lizard into thinking you&#039;re somewhere you&#039;re not, and of course crouching and being tactical about your jumps.<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/tneDR.gif" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />Currently I have a system where the creature&#039;s noise detection ties in with the already established visual tracker. When it hears a sound it will go through the creatures it knows to be in the room, and tribute the sound whichever memory of a creature is closest to the sound source. Then it will update its perception of the creature to that new spot. A fun scenario this system supports is a lizard that has fled from a vulture but hasn&#039;t seen that you are in the room - if you make a bunch of noise without showing yourself it will assume it&#039;s the vulture and flee from you haha.<br /><br />Next step is having a little &quot;go check out what made that sound&quot; behavior for situations where the creature does not have any idea what might have made the sound, such as the standard stealth game situation where you throw a rock to have a stationary NPC go investigate and move out of your way. <br /><br />Also I&#039;m going to need to work a bit with the lizard animation to attempt to communicate when the lizard has picked up a sound. That&#039;s going to be a fun challenge haha!</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/063#1247">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

Could probably do this simply by displacing the perceived sound source a bit in a random direction in those cases. I think I&#039;ll try it out, but while it is realistic it also introduces yet another random factor into the game - something of which there&#039;s already too much. If the game is completely unpredictable it can&#039;t really be played because each action may have any outcome. If it&#039;s deterministic however you can count on stuff to work in a specific way - for example jumping on a floor above a lizard and have it go to that spot to investigate, rather than going somewhere else. So it&#039;s a balance, but yeah, there should definitely be a little bit of fuzziness to the hearing.<br /><br />Haha yeah we want to avoid the exclamation mark if we can! We have a bunch of other things going on, none of which are as clear as an HUD element, but I think that all of them combined will be enough to make an experienced player know their stealth state. A lizard that has spotted you starts emitting bubbles from its head, the head is shaking, the lizard starts moving much faster and opens its mouth. I haven&#039;t yet gotten around to the actual lizard vocalization, but that&#039;s going to play a big part as well - there&#039;ll be hissing and screeching. One thing we&#039;ve been talking about is subtle sound cues for &quot;hostile creature spotted you&quot; and &quot;hostile creature lost track of you&quot; etc. Not a loud ugly sample, but just subtle little effects that can weigh in with the rest of the little signals the game gives you to help you form an idea about what is going on and how bad a situation you&#039;re in. This won&#039;t be very clear to a new player compared to a HUD pop-up, but hopefully you will grow into it. This is sort of where the player&#039;s progression is at in our game - we don&#039;t have levels and barely any equipment you can carry with you, instead it&#039;s about the player slowly learning how to interpret and maneuver the signs and signals of this fictive world. Or that&#039;s the idea at least, let&#039;s see how well we do haha!<br /><br /><b>Update 438</b><br /><br />Further messing around with hearing. I got the &quot;go check out what made that sound&quot; behavior in for lizards, and then had to do a lot of tuning to make them less confused about everything that was going on. The main situation was two lizards fighting and me running by on a floor above - the challenge was to make them understand that they each saw the other lizard right in front of them, and thus conclude that the sound above probably was coming from a third entity which might be worth checking out. After some fussing it seems to roughly work! Also crouching mode is now silent - actually completely silent, which might be a bit too much. But it&#039;s a lot of fun to trick a lizard by jumping in some spot or throwing a rock, and then quickly slithering away along some clever route in the crouch mode. <br /><br />Also, we&#039;re starting to think about a new region.<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/ZIFob.gif" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />James has been trying out some architecture and layouts, and I&#039;ve been messing a bit with a palette and some settings that are going to be needed, such as wave amplitude settings for the water.<br /><br />The waves don&#039;t look very amazing at this point, a bit too regular and machine-like. I think that some light randomization might help a lot. <br /><br />This region is going to be ocean-inspired (maybe it&#039;s the actual ocean, maybe it&#039;s just a very large cistern or flooded area, depending on if you want to imagine this industrial complex as something city-sized that ends at the shoreline, or something larger o_O).<br /><br />Contrary to Drainage System where the water elements were coupled with some claustrophobia in narrow underground pipes, this is going to be about large spaces where you can swim freely, which I think will be a lot of fun. Part of the gameplay will happen up in the structures sticking out above the surface, part of it down in the actual water, and obviously you will be safe in neither place. </div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/063#1248">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

I think it looks a bit better. <br /><br />Also I&#039;ve started skinning the new creature. James and I call this critter &quot;Jet Fish&quot; and its specialty is fast swimming. What the head will look like I&#039;m still sketching on, but I&#039;ve started on the lower part used for locomotion.<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/VelvetyKaleidoscopicHawk.gif" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />The creature has two strong tadpole-like tails that work together to create an even forward thrust in the water. It&#039;s important to the feeling I&#039;m going for that the speed is even, and these two spiraling tails seem to create a plausible constant swimming motion. When jumping out of the water the creature uses water stored in its body to propel itself upward with a jet, and the two tails are just flexing, probably their muscles help squeezing the water out somehow. <br /><br />The actual water coming out should probably look nicer than this, just not sure how to do it. Perhaps a similar technique to the smoke. <br /><br />For the upper body I&#039;m not sure yet, I think it&#039;s going to have some pectoral fins as the two tails seem to be way better at pushing forward than they would be at any actual steering. </div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/063#1257">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

That&#039;s how I do tentacles etc, but not everything is triangle meshes. Quite a lot is also hand drawn 1-bit sprites that are rotated and stretched etc, and there is a bit of traditional animation in there as well - for example I might do a bunch of frames for a creature showing it rotated around its own axis, and then I combine that with actually rotating the sprite in code to get a 2-axis rotation. As for the engine, Unity&#039;s render pipeline and input are used, but the main loop, the game architecture (what is a room, what is terrain, etc etc) and all the object classes are my own.<br /><br />@hypedupdawg, the waves are just a sine wave that&#039;s applied on top of the physics simulation :S<br /><br />@Crispy75 haha let&#039;s be done before that!<br /><br /><b>Update 441</b><br /><br />Jet fish coming along! Still no pectoral fins, but a body and some eyes. Also they sprout whiskers like carp, which are individualized. Now it looks like a tadpole/carp/squid/prawn - I&#039;m always happy when a creature takes on a style of its own and sort of leaves its real-life inspirations behind.<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/ZestyPlayfulAlpineroadguidetigerbeetle.gif" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />The eyes switch between underwater mode and air mode - under water they&#039;re big with a large pupil, up in the air they become like small amphibian eyes:<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/5P2DW.gif" alt="" border="0" /></div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/063#1258">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

I think making the first tail segments very rigid and then have it taper off might achieve something like it.<br /><br />For the poop propulsion and general grossness, that was actually sort of what I was going for... </div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/063#1259">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div><br></body>

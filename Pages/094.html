I would love to see a similar sort of thoughtful analysis from Joar and James on the reception of Rain World.<br /></div><br />OOF those tumbleseed numbers are rough, sheesh. <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/shocked.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> i assumed it was doing well based on the reception my friends gave it.<br /><br />idk! were weird because to a certain extent... we never really cared about how it was received? it was never a product for us, so we probably dont have too much to say about it in that regard. like, if we were trying to make a game that we were designing for people to like, and this or that aspect didnt work out, then maybe we&#039;d do some examination and finding out where we went wrong would be interesting to read. <br /><br />but rain world was a sort of personal art project that we were super into for our own art weirdo / creative reasons, and then some other people got into it, and then it snowballed bigger and bigger into this amazing opportunity for us to just DO WHATEVER ART WE WANTED TO for years on end. incredible. our expectations were literally zero and we&#039;ve gotten to live amazing lives for the past 5 years and met incredible friends and fans from all over the world. the fact that its already sold so well is still insane to me. but none of that was designed. objectively speaking, so much of the game is &quot;extremely bad decisions&quot; from any rational gamedev standpoint. we just thought they were cool and did them anyway. if it tanked we would have said &quot;yep, that totally makes sense&quot;. it has all been pure self-indulgence. <br /><br />so idk, if i were to any sort of &quot;useful to the community&quot; devtalk about rain world post mortem it would be just about tedious stuff like dealing with publishers and porting teams, various higher-level decision making stuff thats &quot;important for success&quot; and all super dry and boring and doesnt reflect our intentions or the spirit of what were doing. id so much rather talk about how cool the RW discord server is, or how wild and dedicated the fans are, the incredible fan art community, etc etc. we didnt make this weird ass emo game to throw it into a powerpoint presentation in front of a bunch of people in button up shirts, we made it to communicate some feelings through the aether; some emotion, some atmosphere, some mood, some certain sensibilities. so seeing the results of that is what im interested in at the end. but its probably not really helpful to anyone elses game making process!</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/094.html#1863">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

But an issue is that now Rain World is in 7 different languages, so there might be some time with localization before we can blast it out to steam.

Multiplayer and singleplayer Rain World have different stakes and different pacing - they&#039;re almost two different games. And they fit two different audiences. By hiding multiplayer features behind singleplayer progression you would limit the enjoyment of people who would enjoy it the most. I think there should be an option to unlock all of the multiplayer stuff from the multiplayer itself, or people will just download everything-unlocked savefiles.<br /></div><br />definitely a valid point, though we have our reasons (which imo will be pretty cool once they are discovered). i think with the sheer volume of multiplayer stuff were including, as well as the fact that it can all be unlocked in any difficulty mode, should be enough to mitigate any off-putting feelings on this. there will be a ton of playability just from the start, and honestly i think it would be pretty overwhelming if everything was included from the beginning. </div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/094.html#1874">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

Sorry about the radio silence, I&#039;ve been churning insanely on this update. Step by step Rain World is becoming closer to the vision, and an important part of that is of course multiplayer...<br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc_z-jCHq-A&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank"><table style="background-color:#b090a040; border:1px solid #ffffff; padding:5px"><td><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/LOST IMAGE.png" width="150px" alt="" border="0"/></td></table></a><br /><br />In the video you can see some of the new creatures as well! We made sure not to show anything that hasn&#039;t made its way to the internet already, but actually the update has a few completely unrevealed creatures as well.<br /><br />Alright, back at it!

Good question, thats something weve talked about a lot. <br /><br />The general audio experience is mostly ambient / atmospheric / environmental sounds to establish a sense of place, with &quot;music&quot; being used to establish specific moods we want to convey to the player, such as when discovering a new region, highlighting the emotion of a narrative point, or surrounding some object / creature / whatever that has some significance attached to it. <br /><br />In this context the audio should function almost like a natural HUD, giving you hints as to what creatures are nearby, how close the rain is, etc., so we dont want to clutter it up too much with music-for-music&#039;s-sake.<br /></div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/066.html#1303">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

As much as we both liked the funky distorted style of the alpha and the clever architectural rain silhouettes, they just introduce too much visual noise to be able to do anything else with, meaning that we&#039;d have to be introducing other fonts, figure out ways of making it work with the illustrations, and it just gets super messy. <br /><br />Perhaps most importantly, we came to the conclusion that the thing people care about in Rain World is THE SLUGCAT of course. So thats where we should to put the focus. Everything else should serve to support that, rather than fight for visual space. </div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/066.html#1308">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

We have a candidate now that both James and I agree is good and which has been getting generally positive responses <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0" /> I&#039;m sorry if it feels like we&#039;re bulldozing a bunch of your opinions here, that&#039;s not at all our intention - but we are in a slight tight spot because we&#039;re stuck between a deadline and our talented illustrator being off to a convention, so we had to pick something and go with it for now. <br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/q16uD.png" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />It&#039;s pretty probable that the illustration might change - this one was actually created as a &quot;sketch&quot; by Del and then given a slight clean up and pixel finish by myself, so I think we&#039;ll give her an opportunity to do a final version at one point or another. Also I have this idea that I&#039;d want to see a version similar to this but with the slugcat looking out to the left which would add a bit of drama to the composition, I imagine. <br /><br />That said, we are really stoked about the direction of this one - it&#039;s clean and stylish, <i>legible </i>contrary to the old one, and the slugcat hits that sweet spot between cute and creepy! <br /><br />As a result of showing the game at conventions we know from public feedback that to many people the game is &quot;the slugcat game&quot;, meaning that the slugcat being the main character of the logo would make a lot of sense for public recognition. For this reason we also decided to go with a rather toned down version of the typography - the slugcat should draw the eye, the letters are there to discover next. You might also notice that the letters aren&#039;t quite as bright as the highlights on the illustration.

I&#039;m not convinced about those Rs of yours, to me they have a bit of club foot with that one leg being thicker and extending to outside of the curved line, but I really like that W!<br /><br />The font is based on a public domain font called <a href="https://www.dafont.com/rodondo.font" target="_blank">rodondo</a>, but has undergone some modifications where I&#039;ve for example made it thinner and adjusted a bunch of stuff around. If you look at the R there you&#039;ll see that it&#039;s actually even more pinched together than the one I&#039;m rolling, I&#039;ve been moving that leg out a bit. So I agree with you in kind but not in scale, if that makes sense &nbsp;<img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0" /><br /><br />The all white slugcat looks pretty nice IMO! Actually I have been doing a few tests like that myself as well, as a logo needs to be able to work in one color print. Maybe the silhouette could be a bit more distinctive in some places, but as said we&#039;re rushing to a deadline right now and it&#039;s pretty likely we&#039;ll return to this down the line.<br /><br />As for the reduced color count on the slugcat, that was my attempt to clean it up a bit and make it closer to the graphics of the game, but I would be totally up for seeing what a smooth unlimited color finish would look like as well! As long as the outline is sharp rather than blurry and there&#039;s a way to get around obvious brush strokes. Maybe when we get Del back!</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/066.html#1314">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

As I said I&#039;m pretty sure we&#039;ll return to it for polish, so I&#039;ll try it out then&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0" /> <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0" /><br /><br /><b>Update 458</b><br /><br />New creature coming up!<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/VerifiableBaggyAsiansmallclawedotter.gif" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />The idea is that this critter will be able to lay on the floor like a big sea elephant/grub, but then it can also shoot up in the sky with looooong extendable legs.<br /><br />I&#039;m very inspired by Dali&#039;s long legged elephants for this one.<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/homeboaboa-envsrcboawebsitesite_mediadali-les-elephants.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" border="0" /><br /><br />With these long legs it will be able to stride across the worm grass fields and then pull them in and lay down to eat some sort of plant in its grazing pastures in between. The leg movement is supposed to be a <i>little bit</i> less clumsy, though I don&#039;t know how good I can make it. Good thing it&#039;s all fantasy creatures &nbsp;<img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /><br /><br />I&#039;ll work a bit more on locomotion, and then my plan is that in the skinning phase I will draw legs on top of these tentacles that are only somewhat true to their orientation, hopefully enabling me to fake a slightly less wobbly movement haha!</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/066.html#1315">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

All will be considered. For the time being, it is water under the bridge though. As Joar mentioned, we had a tight deadline for this aspect, and assets have already been shipped for the purposes of this particular logo iteration. It will likely be revisited again when we get nearer to release and we have everything else set. We&#039;ve had universal positive response to it outside of the devlog, the people less familiar with the project, so we&#039;ll look at this all with the long view a few months down the line and see how things feel&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/gentleman.gif" alt="Gentleman" border="0" /><br /><br />(Whats amusing for me is remembering how much everyone HATED the last logo, and the nightmare thread fires that happened around the creation of that. Now of course many people fondly remember it, haha. As always, change is bad.)<br /><br /><br />Anyway, moving on! We&#039;ve got a lot of game to make, so have to keep on the grind. I was very much enjoying the posts of screenshots from The Mist and war of the worlds, etc, as inspiration for this new beast (nicknamed the Raindeer, yes yes we know.) As for the behavior and role, I dont want to spoil too much of course but as usual Christian and Teod have made some very close guesses.<br /><br />I havent been posting much recently, as most of the level stuff right now isnt so flashy. Im currently working on a subregion that connects Suburban to Linear Farms, so ive been experimenting with finding a gradation of the plainer, boxy &quot;valley&quot; SU style and assets with the more much detailed open horizon LF style:<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/pUzLpvXl.png" alt="" border="0" /><br />detail: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/pUzLpvX.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/pUzLpvX.png</a><br /><br />you&#039;ll notice a liberal application of worm grass, which has quickly become my favorite rain world creature.&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0" /> <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0" /> <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0" /><br /><br />and other task is creating the wide stretches of crop farms:<br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/r5990VAl.png" alt="" border="0" /><br />detail: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/r5990VA.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/r5990VA.png</a><br /><br />not terribly exciting, i know. that should change soon though, as new tiles are incoming.<br /><br />We&#039;re probably a solid halfway through the region, but of course i want to wait to see how the Raindeer plays before going too much further with LF room geometries, as the rest of the terrain will be its turf.</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/066.html#1316">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

The mood we&#039;re going for is &quot;grim cartoon&quot;, with the slugcat being more &quot;cartoon&quot; and most other stuff being more &quot;grim&quot;. Still its black stare and the dramatic lighting conveys a hint of that gloomy atmosphere, meaning it hits the right balance for us. <br /><br /><b>Update 459</b><br /><br />More work on locomotion and I also started a bit of the skinning process of the legs, as it didn&#039;t really make sense to work on leg movement without knowing somewhat what it will end up looking like.<br /><br />Also the creature is now better at handling uneven terrain; instead of just throwing its body out over a ledge (and stumbling and falling) it carefully places a leg or two on the below level and then ease itself out.<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/NegativeMediumFluke.gif" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />Going up a ledge is a bit more difficult as the corner tends to &quot;cut off&quot; the trailing legs and make the creature lose its support, but by having it stay a bit more clear of the actual corner this behavior is also getting better.<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/ShortFrenchIbis.gif" alt="" border="0" /></div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/066.html#1318">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

ATM it doesn&#039;t really have a good distinction between front and back, it mostly just thinks of them as &quot;my four legs&quot;, but that could def be a nice touch!<br /><br />@Keith, thank you sir! If you go one page back you can see a debug visualization of what the legs work like behind the skin that is pasted on top of them. Those tentacles are composed of two main components, the semi-transparent &quot;ghost tentacles&quot; which work in tile space and make sure that they never overlap terrain, and the jointed physics tentacles on top of that which provides a bit more plausible movement. <br /><br />The creature ray-traces from its body downwards trying to find a good grip position when it moves a tentacle, and when it does so path-finds a way to it in tile space. Then the tile space &quot;ghost tentacle&quot; starts to move along that path, dragging the floaty physics tentacle with it.<br /><br />On top of that I draw what you actually see in this post above. I use the positions of the physics tentacle in the debug visualization, but relate to them somewhat liberally, basically just using them to make sure that the leg is not super obviously sticking through a piece of solid terrain. The elbow bends are accomplished with a simple inverse kinematic formula, google <i>inverse kinematics</i> for more info.<br /><br />Hope that was somewhat helpful, it&#039;s getting a bit late over here haha &nbsp;<img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/tired.gif" alt="Tired" border="0" /></div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/066.html#1319">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

I&#039;m very interested in both game art and traditional animation, while I do of course also enjoy well executed 3D graphics.<br /><br />What I find, though, is that an illusion that has much work put into it, whether it is the usage of parallax layers versus 3D rendering, photo-referenced colors or a hand-picked pallette, it&#039;s that the illusions that people put time, effort and love into, are the one that live and breathe the most to me. <br /><br />Say, comparing Porco Rosso to Pacific Rim (I am so sorry), despite pacific rim using a system to set up the visual illusion that is far more like our real world, with an actual 3D space where things are taking place, the movie that helps my suspension of disbelief that most is still the hand-animated one, where 3D space is completely abstracted, calculated either by numbers or intuition by someone drawing on a flat paper.<br /><br />What I&#039;m getting at here is that this &#039;lovingly crafted illusion&#039; thing that really gets me going, is something that the visuals of Rain World also brings me. I think this game is absolutely precious. Even if I never play it, just looking at gifs from it has already given me something on a &#039;spiritual level&#039; that I can bring with me into life and into my art.<br /></div><br />Wow, this is such a nice thing to say&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/shocked.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> I really hope I can live up to it. If I can&#039;t, I hope you&#039;ll be able to hold on to that first impression of yours!<br /><br /><b>Update 136</b><br />Started porting the player&#039;s animation, which has a few quirks to it. There&#039;s a lot of manual work such as logging where the rotational pivot point is for each sprite etc. But I also have some bigger questions to think about.<br /><br />One solution I&#039;ve been contemplating is to have a &quot;cosmetic module&quot; for each creature, which holds things that don&#039;t really affect gameplay such as tails and paws. Then I could just drop that module when the creature is off-screen, and save some CPU on off-screen creatures. Also it might be a nice structure to have in an object, all the stuff that actually matters in one place and all the fluff in another.<br /><br />Problem is that then I&#039;d need to have a players&#039; cosmetic module, a lizards&#039; cosmetic module, etc, and then I&#039;d have an entire separate but perfectly parallel inheritance tree for those, which feels like a weird an un-pure solution.<br /><br />Also, this feels like it could be a massive case of premature optimation, heh. Maybe I should do it the proper way, and implement what&#039;s easiest, run the profiler, and then optimize where it actually matters.&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/huh.gif" alt="Huh?" border="0" /></div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/029.html#568">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

There will be a few of those too. The good news is that I have the framework for a separate graphics module up, and that I&#039;ve started implementing a tail. The bad news is that I&#039;ve spend the whole long day trying to keep the nodes of the tail out of the level geometry, and still haven&#039;t gotten it to work. <br /><br />For the cosmetic body parts, I don&#039;t want the physics to be <i>too </i>good - if I do it like I do the physics for actual objects, they won&#039;t ever be able to pass through geometry and you might end up with part of your tail on the other side of a wall. Instead I want them to just be pushed out of geometry in a somewhat reasonable direction, without jumping around like crazy and without entering geometry unnecessarily. That&#039;s harder than it sounds. If the geometry was all circles it would be super easy - I have a go-to solution which is just pushing the nodes apart according to their radii. But the level geometry is compromised of squares, and I can&#039;t translate the algorithm in any reasonable way.<br /><br />The only comfort to be found in this is that when I solve it, I&#039;ll be able to use that solution for all body part - slugcat hands, lizard tails, fly wings, etc. Stay tuned!<br /><br />Edit: Wooho I solved it! Never underestimate the power of going online and whining to strangers, it obviously helped this time.

Can you customize how it does the setup of vertex buffers and other parameters sent to the GPU?<br /></div>I don&#039;t know yet, as I haven&#039;t encountered those problems so far. What I have had some problems with is that Unity&#039;s way of reaching a shader (for setting parameters) is through the material which the shader is connected to, and I haven&#039;t been able to reach the material used by Futile&#039;s sprites. Instead I&#039;ve had to use global shader params, but I&#039;ll have to actually solve that sooner or later.<br /><br /><b>Update 138</b><br />Slugcat animation is coming along! I was stalled a bit because I didn&#039;t know how to approach the tail now that I don&#039;t have beizer curves. Like always when I&#039;m stuck it was James who helped me get moving again. We checked out the vector graphic options in Unity&#039;s app store, and after a bit of research it was clear that they all just used countless triangles to draw the vector lines. <br /><br />So, then we decided that if that was the case, I could as well move around triangles myself. So today I made a triangle mesh object, where you can define a number of triangles, and some vertices. The triangles are just references to three different vertices, meaning that sharing vertices between triangles is super easy. If I want to make a four-sided polygon for example, a quad, I can just go:<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">TriangleMesh.Triangle&#91;] tris = new TriangleMesh.Triangle[2] {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; new TriangleMesh.Triangle (0, 1, 2), <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; new TriangleMesh.Triangle (1, 2, 3)<br />};<br /><br />TriangleMesh mesh = new TriangleMesh (&quot;Futile_White&quot;, tris);<br /></div><br />And then when I move around vertices 1 and 2, which are shared by both triangles, both triangles will change accordingly.<br /><br />The test run of this structure is the slugcat tail, for which I programmed the physics the other day as you might remember. Behold - 4 little balls of physics and 13 triangles drawing a shape on top of them:<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/t5A.gif" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />Looks pretty smooth right? <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0" /><br /><br />Next up, probably a head or something. </div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/029.html#570">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

It&#039;s just round little balls, and it relies on their spacing being smaller than a tile for them not to end up on the opposite side of walls. But, it&#039;s just cosmetics, so whatever works. The physics for actual objects is a bit more reliable.<br /><br />James pointed out that the new tail was a lot limper than the old one, which looked a bit stiffer and had more body to it. So I made a few adjustments - basically a stiffness that declines over the segments. The base is the stiffest, and the very tip is still slimy.<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/yPjbd.gif" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />Small detail, but it&#039;s that kind of stuff I love to do haha!

Now we have legs displaying different sprites if you&#039;re climbing, crawling, wall sliding etc, and also different body positions for a bunch of stuff, such as climbing a pole, sliding on a wall and more. There is <i>a lot</i> of hooking up the upper body&#039;s x-position to a 3 pixel wide sinus curve over movement and such, which maybe isn&#039;t very exciting. But the animation is what many people like about this game, and that consists entirely of those little quirks, so I feel happy about going over them again. Even more so now that I have a template to look at, and don&#039;t have to spend 30 minutes deciding if that sinus wave should have an amplitude of 2, 3.5 or 4. <br /><br />This is what the animation system of rain world essentially is - it&#039;s actually not as procedural as you might think, because it&#039;s not just a magic formula that makes everything look cool. Instead it&#039;s heaps and heaps of special cases, hand crafted &quot;animations&quot; that are made more or less frame by frame, but not by drawing sprite sheets but by deciding what force should affect what body part at what time. The cool thing about it certainly isn&#039;t that it saves a lot of time, but that combinations of animations and smooth transitions between them can exist. If one body part is for example animated to do something, those motions might be defined in relation to the overall alignment of the body, which will make it look a little bit different each time depending on what else is going on. </div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/029.html#577">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

So, I have been playing, and maybe it is just me, but I kinda liked the low fps/jerkiness of the early alpha, (or at least I think I would, based on the footage I have seen). This may not be everyone, but the slugcat&#039;s movement doesn&#039;t feel very animal, if you know what I mean. I tested this theory out with an fps limiter, and while visually it wasn&#039;t a huge improvement, it <i>felt</i> better somehow. Maybe you know what I am talking about. Or maybe those little visual details, like it scrambling to get up a ledge to a platform, (in that slugcat life video I think). It lasted less than a second, but it is little details like that I am talking about. All of this is freaking amazing, don&#039;t get me wrong, but remember the little details too... Speaking of which, what about the shelters? I remember that alpha video with the pups, where it was those huge industrial doors. Someone earlier brought this up, saying how the current one looks like it was specifically designed for the slugcat. Maybe have some big ones, with little nooks and crannies inside to sleep in?<br /><br />TL:DR where are all those things from the alpha videos?<br /></div><br />Yeah, there are certain qualities of the alpha that are lost, but I think that&#039;s pretty much to be expected when you re-build from the ground up! However there are quite a lot of things that are significantly better with this new build, so it evens out haha ~<br /><br />That framerate thing you mentioned I&#039;ve noticed as well. The lingo build was supposed to run at 40 fps, but was in fact closer to 20, which was a much more forgiving environment to animate in. Have you ever been drawing a sketch, and it looks great, and then you add color and stuff and it doesn&#039;t look as good any more? The brain has a tendency to fill in missing information, actually it&#039;s often so good at it that the filler material is better than something an artist can come up with. I&#039;d say that the reason some people think the lingo alpha had more animal-like animation is because it had a loooot lower framerate, and because you know it&#039;s supposed to be animals you fill in that missing info with your own animal stuff (one example is that many people have mentioned seeing the slugcat claw at a ledge to get up - a behavior I have in fact never specifically implemented). <br /><br />All the creatures in the new build have more sophisticated animation than any critter in the lingo alpha, but the framerate is also way higher which makes any imperfect movement more obvious. Another thing that plays into this is that the slugcat itself was the very first creature I animated for the unity build, and is also the one you look at all the time. So the slugcat will definitely get some polish before release. I have been contemplating capping the frame rate, but at the end of the day I don&#039;t think it would be worth it. Obscuring the art to make mistakes less obvious feels wrong, and is generally not very effective at the end of the day, as any illustrator who has tried to save a bad drawing with filters or blur knows. The higher framerate creates a more professional and smooth presentation for the entire game, and it keeps me on edge as an animator!<br /><br />As for the shelters, the original concept was that the region gates and the shelters would be one and the same - but as the regions got absurdly huge that idea had to go. However, the &quot;art idea&quot; still lives on in the current region gates:<br /><br /><a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/gtc4f.png" target="_blank"><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/gtc4f.png" alt="" width="400" height="227" border="0" /></a></div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/072#1421">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

I guess it would sort of make sense coming from a classical animation pipeline where you draw each pose for a character - just having it switch image every second frame but updating the position of the sprite every frame. For me though I doubt it would be possible, as at the end of the day my animations are basically <i>only </i>positions, no image swapping... Like, most of my creatures consist of 2-10 &quot;chunks&quot; with a position each, and sometimes hundreds of cosmetic little details each with a position and velocity, so there&#039;d be no way to pick one of them and decide that &quot;this one is the real position of the creature&quot;.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1191461#msg1191461">Quote from: Schoq on October 22, 2015, 08:14:55 AM</a></div><div class="quote">I&#039;m irrationally frustrated about not being able to see this new creature and area!<br /></div> <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/eyebrows.gif" alt="Well, hello there!" border="0" /> There is like, 4 times the content of a standard region in there, and there&#039;s more to come!

It also has hearing, but only when standing still.<br /><br />To compensate for this it has that start and stop behavior, where it switches between sensory awareness and movement.

This is the sort of violence I&#039;s ideally like for the game to have - short bursts of action, and the violence never being a goal in itself but slugcat also not hesitating to use it if it&#039;s the only way to survive a situation. <br /><br />As you can see that medium sized centipede manages to attach itself to my lower body for a little while there (will be less confusing with a sound cue), which brings up a detail about how the creature works. They kill you with electricity, and need to attach both ends to form a full circuit. The bigger ones are more effective at it, and can use their weight to restrain you more during this phase. With the smaller ones you have a little bit more of a window to do something, as can be seen in the gif.<br /><br />James and I had a talk and decided that further on as we do some brushing up on the damage system there might be a few more factors making them more dangerous the larger they are - maybe the smaller ones will have to zap you multiple times, for example. With wildly varying sizes like this the danger should vary with the size, so that those huge buggers are just as dangerous as they look!</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/072#1430">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

This region does not joke around&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/shocked.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /><br /><br /><a href="http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/10/30/aiKTY.png" target="_blank"><table class="lostimage"><td><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/LOST IMAGE.png" width="150px" alt="" border="0"/></td></table></a><br /><br />Sorry about the blur, it feels silly but now when we have gone through all this trouble of secrecy it makes sense ~ <br /><br />As you can see, you could fit several suburban regions inside this one. However, simple area-by-area comparison doesn&#039;t nearly do it justice because it has basically only huge rooms, which are denser on the map. The green color is marking 8 screens in suburban vs 8 screens in subterranean, to give you a sense of this. In terms of screens, I&#039;d say that that topmost row (the un-blurred one) is about on par with the entirety of suburban. <br /><br />On top of this it is also the most content rich region in the game, with by far the most region specific stuff in it. Exciting! </div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/072#1434">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

We&#039;re both dying not being able to show it off to you guys, but believe me its worth the wait to see everything in context. <br /><br />Also Joar and I were excitedly talking earlier about all the crazy unexpected / hilarious creature interactions going on. Subterranean spans most of the width of the game map, and as a result it has a good selection of creatures from all the different regions represented, in many cases together for the first time. Its the best example of the &quot;open ecosystem&quot; feeling yet, and requires knowledge of all of the different creatures hunting behaviors in order to have any chance of survival. Unexpected allies emerge, purely through the fallout of the web of predator-prey chaos roiling around you. Its a very cool experience, if you dont mind me saying it. </div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/072#1435">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

We have a month planned for &quot;level polish&quot;. Mostly it will be cosmetic, but a few of the early regions will get some structural reworking as well. We did this already with a problematic region and had very good results, so I&#039;m kinda looking forward to it!</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/072#1436">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

Like the suburban region with 1/6th as many screens as the subterranean.<br /></div><br />yep! some more than others. Suburban will definitely see some expansions, and probably an entire new subregion. For now the polish pass will be focused on improving whats already there and adding narrative / set-piece stuff rather than expansion per se, but there certainly will be some as a result. <br /><br />As tedious as it may be on my end, whats nice about the modular room layout system we&#039;re using is that once a region map is setup its very easy for me to attach new rooms/paths, and therefore new content. ive setup pretty much every region with the potential for future expansion in mind, and the infrastructure can pretty much support as much additional content as we care to add. i have *LOTS* of ideas for this stuff, so hopefully the game will be successful enough so warrant it post-release. </div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/072#1438">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

Early into the port from the old programming language, Joar considered using an effect similar to the one above to &quot;snap to&quot; camera points when moving from screen to screen, but it would have made level files literally 30x larger and caused all sorts of other problems for what was essentially just a 1-time &quot;hey coooool&quot; eye candy transition effect, so we dropped it.<br /><br />But that said, all of this is perspective is actually in every level screen now, subtly transitionings to other perspectives when going through multi-screen rooms. i just choose how its framed when its rendered to give specific effects to highlight aspects of the gameplay of terrain. <br /><br />its pretty hard to communicate this without seeing, so i think even a lot of long time thread readers get thrown off when we talk about it, so let me see if this helps.<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/3082xt7l.png" alt="" border="0" /><br />detail: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/3082xt7.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/3082xt7.png</a><br /><br />notice how you can see the tops of the platforms here, especially the square-ish ones? and the pipes with the grating on the bottom left and right point down and outwards? Thats a top down perspective to highlight the surfaces that you can jump on and set some &quot;im on some tall precarious thing surrounded by a big fall&quot; mood.<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/JPGimVFl.png" alt="" border="0" /><br />detail: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/JPGimVF.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/JPGimVF.png</a><br /><br />here in the bottom part of that room, everything is facing upwards to show scale: &quot;now things are towering above me&quot;. you can see it in those same sorts of grates mid screen, but facing outward and slightly upwards. etc etc. its a subtle thing, but a totally essential aspect of the rain world look. so thats what we talk about with all this 30 layers / diorama / &nbsp;perspective stuff.</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/067.html#1324">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

But I never thought that moving &quot;pictures&quot; even 30 at a time could be a problem for nowadays computers. Or is there a difference between pictures/images and textures. Maybe I&#039;m also digging to deep. Just interested. <br /></div><br />Yeah I thought so too! Turns out that even in modern 3D games, you usually don&#039;t seem to run that many high-res textures where the color of each pixel down to the 256 color values must be maintained and conveyed - they do other tricks such as repeating the same texture in clever ways by for example re-coloring it. A lot of stuff happens in shaders. When researching this I came across a pretty amazing little community that made an art out of rendering super good looking 3D scenes using only shaders, basically no textures. Either they&#039;d use some little 10*10 noise texture or something, or just generate perlin noise in the GPU. Really cool stuff!<br /><br />But yep, moving about 30 (larger than) screen sized pixel perfect textures turned out to be too much for even my modern computer, at least through unity&#039;s rendering pipe line (which I have no reason to believe to be particularly bad) so we had to scrap the parallax effect. Basically everything else that is cool looking in the game since making that decision is based on our current setup (pre rendered screen per screen textures that have the depth coded into them) though , so I&#039;m pretty happy with the trade-off!</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/067.html#1325">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

So that room above was a test of using &quot;soft death pits&quot;, where the death is shown either due to the fall or to some gross creature lurking at the bottom. seems to work just fine, so when we get into the polish pass of the levels ill go back and turn every one of the terrestrial off-screen death pits into something like this.<br /><br />note: that wont apply to sky regions such as Chimney Canopy and Sky Islands, which are supposed to be very high up<br /><br /></div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/067.html#1326">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

Also it wasn&#039;t quite dangerous enough for the huge fearsome fields he was making. The two birds with one stone solution was to make the worm grass transition to this super worm grass in larger patches, which also works a bit differently than the original worm grass - rather than tracking the pull of each worm it works tile by tile, creating a more classic gamey &quot;lava&quot; effect; basically if you fall down there you die. <br /><br />We plan on making large swaying seas of this, with the rain deer striding across it.

Instead I get this: <br /><br /><a href="http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/08/07/RSE74.png" target="_blank">http://imgwiz.com/images/2015/08/07/RSE74.png</a><br /><br />&nbsp;<img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/huh.gif" alt="Huh?" border="0" /> <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/huh.gif" alt="Huh?" border="0" /> <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/huh.gif" alt="Huh?" border="0" /><br /><br />Anyone has any idea what that might be?

Possibly something to do with the managed/unmanaged code mix in Unity?<br /><br />Try opening up the &#039;Threads&#039; window while paused and see if there&#039;s any other threads running that you can peek into, they might help you track down your issue.<br /><br /></div><br />Yeah, this is the idea I&#039;ve gotten after some research too - and last time I had similar problems it also showed to be about this. Problem is that I basically don&#039;t know what &quot;symbols&quot; are, this is where some kind of education could have come in handy I guess haha :S Is there some simple explanation? What I understood last time was that it was some kind of registry keeping track of where each point in the compiled code was coming from in the uncompiled code, so that if something went wrong it could show where and why and launch the debugger ... is that about right? <br /><br />When the symbols are missing for a piece of code, how can you like, tell it to add that code in then? Or why doesn&#039;t it do that automatically?<br /><br />For your more practical idea - in VS all the windows are empty, I only get that message and that&#039;s it. In mono develop I can pause and it shows a call stack and a thread, named something that makes me think it has to do with waiting (as in some kind of framerate cap) but no code, and there&#039;s nothing I can recognize as written by me.&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/huh.gif" alt="Huh?" border="0" /><br /><br />Well, at least I solved the problem by now, good old manual way ~&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0" /> </div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/067.html#1334">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

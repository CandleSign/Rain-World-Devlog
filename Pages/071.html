Probably won&#039;t get into too much detail with the specifics of it since its among the final regions the player will encounter, but suffice to say that its underground, so totally happy to show off some of the deep cave-like elements we&#039;ve been messing with for the top layer subregion. <br /><br />Joar has whipped up a *fantastic* new (procedural?) dirt tile material and a pair of dark-ish cave palettes to get us going. Worth noting is that we spent a few days fretting on how to make these work, as both aspects are potentially a bit of a departure from how things have been done so far, but i think it came out really well:<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/h5HW5Jx.png" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />detail: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/8wndxmd.png" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/8wndxmd.png</a><br /><br />This sub-region is &quot;Near Surface Subterranean&quot;, so occasionally you come across areas where the cave ceiling has given way and shafts of saturated light shine down, illuminating the walls. So we needed a palette that would work with various lighting types and could also be blended with other &quot;outside&quot; palettes for when transitioning to other surface regions. No easy trick, and Joar did an amazing job! I know its subtle stuff, but definitely worth pointing out as I think its the best palette work in the game so far. Here is the same palette, but deeper underground and with only player lighting:<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/SFwCDX9.png" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />detail: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/gyl3kYY.png" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/gyl3kYY.png</a><br /><br /><br /><br />experimentations continue... so more soon!</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/071#1401">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

Yeah, agreed on all points! The &quot;carry over&quot; of bats has been a thing that has been up since &quot;maze runner&quot; days, and it&#039;s not at all out of the question. Would just have to come up with some UI solution for it that seems clean enough, and some kind of cap so you don&#039;t manage to get 55 bats through some exploit in one run and then don&#039;t ever have to hunt again.<br /><br />Suicidal exploration should be kept at a minimum. One VERY rough measure that could be taken against this could be some kind of extra penalty if you die two times in a row - such as throwing you two save points back (naturally with a corresponding lowering of general game difficulty). That&#039;s... rough, though. The idea is that you should have enough time to both search and catch bats within the same cycle - if that&#039;s viable there won&#039;t really be any reason to do the suicide missions. <br /><br />In later versions it has been made a bit simpler to catch the bats when you are in the swarm room. The idea behind this is that the bulk of the time should be spent exploring looking for the swarm room, not jumping around in frustration trying to catch some elusive bats once you&#039;ve actually gotten there. Together with a lower bat quota I think we have been taking some steps in the right direction since alpha days.<br /><br />Visual indicators (UI or in-world) leading you towards the bats might become necessary, but if it&#039;s possible we&#039;d like to do without it. Would be a shame to impose on the atmosphere of the rooms with some ever-present visual element like that.<br /><br />All of these ideas are totally possible, and it&#039;s a lot of fun to finally have arrived at the point where we&#039;re implementing and balancing stuff like this!</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/071#1407">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

Now obviously im talking about a stylized solution and not text with words and Xs, but something like this would be the baseline you want to see:<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;fed<br />starvation [ X X X X | X X - - | - - -] full<br /><br /><br /><br />idk, i think previously we had been trying to avoid both status effects and UI, but its time to contemplate it! its interesting, at this point we have the things that we wanted to do with the game pretty well nailed down: the ecosystem, the look, the mood and the huge world exploration, but now its a matter of adjusting the gamification variables and presenting it in a way to encourage the player to continue through. i guess this what happens when you start with an art project and then work &quot;a game&quot; into it!<br /><br /><br />Along those lines, Joar and I were just discussing how we might maintain the players interest in keeping little sluggie surviving in such a death-filled environment. Especially since its (to a degree) a timed play-cycle, how do we make it so that the player doesnt want to just kill themselves to restart if their exploration or hunt isnt immediately going well? <br /><br />This food meter system might offer a solution to that as well, if we think of the regions in a more traditional &quot;level&quot; fashion. With the region gates we have built in &quot;level start&quot; points and the shelters can act as checkpoints. A death when &quot;fed&quot; restarts the player at the the shelter, but a death when &quot;starving&quot; returns the player to the region gate that they entered, scrubbing any progression and giving strong incentive to keep sluggie alive and fed throughout.<br /><br /><br />Then hopefully something like this would allow enough &quot;open world&quot; to keep the gameplay from becoming too forced and linear, but also offers incentive for players that want to progress through the narrative and exploration. Also of course simply adding some sort of &quot;CYCLE 7 SURVIVED&quot; high-score count / achievements at the end of cycles could help further gamify this as well.<br /><br /><br />thoughts?</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/071#1408">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

In the old game, you only had one shelter and thus eating and surviving was the natural goal. Now when there are many shelters it&#039;s easy that the standard play cycle becomes way more about trying to get to the next shelter than about surviving and returning to the same shelter. The priorities has kind of been switched, instead of moving as a means to survive you survive as a means of movement. <br /><br />There are plenty of possible solutions though. The &quot;carry over&quot; of bats could do part of it - in that case it might become worth it to hang out in the same spot to farm some bats for 2 or 3 cycles. Another way could be to penalize death a bit harder (either just death, or something like dying twice in a row). That we&#039;d have to be careful with though, as we don&#039;t want to penalize players for failing too much. Ideally such a penalty wouldn&#039;t be a penalty that puts you back as much as something that keeps you from progressing too quickly into areas you can&#039;t handle until you have learnt to handle the area you&#039;re in. <br /><br />One option we&#039;ve been thinking about is that instead of having the game be one very long session, it could be a couple of smaller sessions, where surviving (or &quot;winning&quot;) a session is rewarded by some more options for your next play. Sort of like how the &quot;rogue-lightes&quot; such as Binding of Isaac and Nuclear Throne and that whole family of games are doing. Like, slightly shorter sessions but accumulation over sessions.<br /><br />What do you guys think? Do you prefer games with one long session, or games where you play a bunch of shorter sessions and have something build up over the course of them? <br /><br />However it goes, we would like to have the player feel a certain satisfaction after the average successful hunt, when you return to your shelter with enough bats to survive. In a situation like that the player would feel the most as one with the slugcat nature, who is all about eating, sleeping and staying alive. When slugcat is happy, the player should be happy too!</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/071#1409">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

Some critters have social memory which they use to keep track of relationships to you and each other - this also goes in the creature state.<br /><br />The problem is that different critters have derived state classes that may contain some extra critter-specific info.<br /><br />So now I&#039;m thinking, should I just tough it out and write a state-to-string method and a string-to-state method for each critter type, or should I serialize this specific piece of data? Then I&#039;d get a mixture of clear text and binary serialization in the saved creature, like this:<br /><br />&lt;C&gt;GreenLizard&lt;D&gt;ID.3371.0.0&lt;D&gt;199.2&lt;D&gt;MQCAACbAgAA0wEoBINARYoSERIALIZATIONoSTRINGoAAAwCAAAAAgAA7&lt;C&gt;<br /><br />My question is - is that just <i>too</i> ugly to even consider? And would it actually do me any good? </div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/071#1412">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

But there is one more region for us to make after this one. We did them in this order for some technical reasons, as the other region will have some important visuals-heavy set-pieces, so we want to use this region as practice before getting there.<br /><br />so yes, even more content! we are content crazy!</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/071#1414">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

It remembers what den you&#039;re in, what swarm rooms are depleted, and now also a bunch of stuff concerning the critters. Health state is saved, as well as den position. Just now I managed to write to and from text methods for the social memory. I spawned a jet fish in the horrible dry landscape of Suburban region, and pulled it with me to the den. When spawning on the next cycle, it still remembered it was angry with me!<br /><br />This social memory doesn&#039;t have all that much use so far, which is mostly because I have yet to write some little engine that can recognize social events. A negative social event would be throwing a rock at a critter, a positive one might be feeding it or saving its life from a predator. Having the AI understand what&#039;s what will take some code that isn&#039;t in yet - for example it should be negative for you to throw a rock towards a critter <i>unless </i>you are hitting (or clearly aiming for) a vulture that is currently swooping down on it, in which case it should be positive. The jet fish get angry when you carry them which is very easy for the code to recognize, which is why that is in there already.<br /><br />This code is nothing I&#039;m too worried about though - it will be a day or so of work and will then be generally applicable on all creatures. What I was worried about was the saving of the social memories, and now that hurdle is cleared.<br /><br />We don&#039;t yet know to what extent we want to work with this stuff, as it will probably only be noticeable to very advanced players. It would be a lot of fun though to slowly build up a friendship or an antagonistic relationship with some creature you often come by - that would be exactly the kind of emergent narrative we want to embrace!</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/071#1416">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

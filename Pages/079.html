Really sorry, but I definitely spoke too soon about getting back to regular updates. It was deadline inferno there for a while, and once through we took a look at the schedule and... there&#039;s like 5 big secret things on there! So, very exciting stuff, but sadly I can&#039;t share it. You&#039;ll get to see it later!<br /><br />James on the other hand has a weeeeeeeell earned month completely off from levels, instead doing what he&#039;s actually all about - music and sound. He says he has written several tracks already, though I haven&#039;t heard them yet. Pretty sure they&#039;re amazing though, as he claimed his artistic direction was More Weirder, which we can all endorse. <br /><br />So, I&#039;m getting back at my mystery tasks. Will check in with you guys from time to time though! </div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/079.html#1561">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

Joar is working on some really cool new setpiece stuff, and im sifting through the old music and audio to see whats salvageable from the past few years of on and off Rain World audio work. <br /><br />There is kind of a lot of music laying around in various stages of completion (around 70 tracks), some gems, but also a good deal of stuff thats either unusable for one reason or another, such as the game moving on stylistically, other later tracks doing a better job of capturing that mood, and of course some i just dont like any more. Pretty glad to do some housecleaning with this, as it will open space for new music! Im also using this time to remix and remaster the older tracks that *do* make the cut, and with that establishing a baseline for consistent volume levels, compression, saturation, etc etc., going forward.&nbsp; Exciting, I know!</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/079.html#1562">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

I either played or watched playthroughs of pretty much everything. <br /><br />right now im in ear-bleed nightmare zone auditioning, filtering and EQing 1000s of ambient audio clips, but all that is going really well. yesterday we tested a dynamic audio system which ill explain a bit more in later posts, but its something we&#039;ve wanted to include for a while were pretty excited with how its all coming together. tonight ill be doing the first region with complete ambiance audio, dynamic audio and maybe some music triggers as well, so definitely on track to get audio done by the end of the month... which is pretty insane, but hey nothing new there!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1221512#msg1221512">Quote from: Prinsessa on February 10, 2016, 10:27:20 AM</a></div><div class="quote">So I think I&#039;m going to start playing around with some Fish AI&#8482; sometime soon...

Any pr0tips from the masters?<br /></div><br />I have one that&#039;s very simple and might be useful!<br /><br />&nbsp;If you have something where you want to compare many different options (such as where to go on the map) - write a function that can grade each option with a score. <br /><br />So for the where to go thing, say that you want them to not get stuck in corners, you want them to stay close to their mates and you want them to stay away from the player. Then in your ScoreOfThisPosition method you add to the score the distance to the closest wall, subtract from the score the distance to the school buddies, and then add the distance to the player x 10 (naturally the different factors need manual tuning). <br /><br />A position that&#039;s inside a wall or otherwise unreachable should just return a float.minValue or something, you never want those.<br /><br />Next step, you have the fish save a goal position. Now, every frame you pick a random position in the room (or a random position reasonably close to the fish) and compare the score of that position to the score of the saved goal position. If the score of the random test position is better, set that as the new goal!<br /><br />This system is cool because it spreads the comparing out over many frames, contrary to comparing every alternative every frame which would be super slow. Also because it has a random element to it you&#039;ll get something that&#039;s a bit unpredictable, but because the goal position can only swap to a better position you know that given some time it will reliably gravitate towards the right behavior. <br /><br />Hope that gets you inspired!

For the sake of clarity, its a super simple one i just put together from the Underhang region:<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/zTADPcs.png" alt="" border="0" /><br />larger: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/nqSniyS.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/nqSniyS.png</a><br /><br />Might look a bit busy even so, but the concepts are pretty simple. Basically, there are 3 main types of sound objects that can be spawned: Omnidirectional, which applies a sound to the entire room; Directional, which pans a sound to the right or left side of the stereo field; and Spot which places a sound object along an X,Y coordinate. All of these are selected out of that large box on the right, which holds all the ambiance audio loops ive been creating over the past month or so, and any loop can be used as any type of sound object,<br /><br />For Spot the player acts as a kind of microphone moving through 2d space, so the nested circles you see represents the area that a sound can be heard in. The inner circle is where the sound is at its peak volume (as chosen by the sliders in that objects option boxes that you can see on the left), and then fading out until the outer circle.<br /><br />So between these 3 tools quite a lot of things can be accomplished, even in a simple form like here. Because you can spawn and blend multiple omnidirectional sounds, you can create a sense of shifting scenery as the player moves from room to room through the regions, giving a cohesive sense of space and aural geography; for instance winds growing stronger as you climb a huge structure, and the ground ambiance slowly fading away. By adding spot sounds to that you can bring to life the background environment: the hum of an old machine, bugs buzzing around a pile of rubble, howling winds on a little hilltop, etc. <br /><br />I&#039;ll do a proper lil video when I hit a stopping point, but here at least is a clip i posted on twitter that shows 10 sec of moving through a sound environment with the audio devtools on so you can see whats happening: <a href="https://twitter.com/RainWorldGame/status/698109778137124864" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/RainWorldGame/status/698109778137124864</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Its super fun, but man did i set myself a huge task, as usual. Initially the idea was going to be to get general ambiance audio per region/subregion and throw in a few Spot objects here and there on certain significant objects to spice it up. But once you&#039;ve established a certain level of detail by adding the Spot sounds, theres no going back; the ear likes to hear the movement of the player through a dynamic sound world, so rooms / screens without the spot sound detail seem noticeably dull by comparison. So now i find myself having to go through all 1467 screens with laser attuned ears.... all in the span of 2 weeks or so. Absolute madness!!! But, its getting done. After i finish Underhang today, theres just one more to do. </div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/079.html#1570">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

ALSO this was before Joar re-attached the low-pass filter, so we miss that cool underwater effect, but thats back in now. <br /><br />what were doing is a *little* weird for sure. a bit of a hybrid system between platformer types where diegetic audio is heavily omni, and the fully spatial audio of 3d games, plus then were throwing in all sorts of strange programmatic stuff like the doppler, randomized pitch/etc functions. its very much like the rest of the game in that regard, lol! but in the context of moving through rooms and regions it makes sense </div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/079.html#1571">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

The game has two regions that could be considered &quot;final&quot; regions, which one is more final depends a bit on your specific playthrough and how you count. They&#039;re Subterranean and Superstructure. I have spent significantly more than a month (working about 200%) on superstructure content.&nbsp; Now I&#039;m there again. James has also spent a month on it, but he says he will be passing over it at least twice again, maybe more. By now, superstructure has an insane amount of content. Not like, half the content of the game, but definitely, say... 6 times the content of a standard region. I hesitate to do the maths, but by the time we finish it we will have spent something like... 4 man-months on that region specifically. None of it has made it to the internet. The region is vast, but the sheer amount of stuff makes it a real problem to fit everything in in a way that doesn&#039;t become a complete cacophony and sensory overload from the very entrance room. <br /><br />Not really sure what this post is about, probably just complaining&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> But yeah, that region&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/shocked.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /></div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/079.html#1572">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

Many people are involved in and affected by the release date and the release date announcement process, so not really up to me &nbsp;<img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/shrug2.gif" alt="Shrug" border="0" /><br /><br />@Torchkas, we haven&#039;t noticed any trouble so far! The game only loads the sounds as they are actually needed, so they&#039;re not all in RAM at once. James has made a crazy amount of ambient sounds, but they&#039;re not all in the same room or even in the same region.</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/079.html#1574">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

Id be interested to see an audit on it though. Theres a few places (huge rooms with tons of stuff going on) where the audio hangs a bit, but joar is confident thats just loading fussiness and is easily fixable. A similar thing happened with the music loading and was fixed without much fuss, so fingers crossed.<br /><br />Finally finished with ambience audio! (or at least got it to a reasonable place to move on from...) Didnt take all that long IRL, only 2 weeks, but man in subjective time that was rough stuff. Its the sort of thing thats requires constant steady concentration to fine details over like, hours and hours and thousand screens, so it is *quite* fatiguing both mentally and aurally. <br /><br />No rest for the wicked though, as im diving right into finishing up the SFX. There is still a ton of SFX triggers to be placed (once Joar gets done with his current project there will be an afternoon and change devoted to that), but for now at least i can catch up on some of the more recent creatures. And by &quot;recent&quot; i mean &quot;Miros bird and lantern mouse&quot; lol. <br /><br />The slog continues!</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/079.html#1575">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

All the rooms would probably require both of our computers working hard for a day or so, during which we&#039;d be limited in the work we could do. But yeah, totally possible! Just to be avoided if possible. Also James has an aversion for the batch renderer because he suspects it doesn&#039;t spit out the room pixel-perfectly the same, but this time around I&#039;ll do some empirical science on that and if it&#039;s actually the case I&#039;ll correct it!</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/057#1120">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

We have officially given up hope on it looooong ago, and we don&#039;t think it&#039;s worth it to spend any time on it. We&#039;re just going to use it to make levels for this game, and then say good-bye to it forever - think of it as an old car that you hope will have <i>just </i>enough life left in it to be able to drive all the way to the scrapyard&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0" /> So yeah but no, I won&#039;t spend time slimming the level editor, I&#039;ll just make it do what we need it to do and then learn my lesson for the next project.<br /><br />@Crispy75, each screen texture is a png of about 0.5mb, and the level geometry (once the AI data is baked in) is about the same, so a screen is ~ 1 meg. James hopes to have 700 of those by the end of it o_0 The disk space of the code is negligible, but the music+sfx will likely occupy some space as well.<br /><br /><b>Question</b><br />Does anyone have any experience with loading sounds dynamically in Unity? I set up this huge system for James to be able to import and work with sounds from a folder, only for us to realize that the reason it had been working on my computer was because I was running the unity editor in the background, which added metadata to the sounds as I put them in the resources folder. James is running the stand-alone, which doesn&#039;t merge the files into the unity project, and as an effect the loading of the sound files doesn&#039;t work <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /><br /><br />I&#039;ve been looking at solutions for dynamic loading of sounds in Unity, with no results so far. Theoretically I think I should be able to use a WWW similarly to how I load the levels, and that seems to work to a degree - I get AudioClips out of it instead of null references or something, and there are no error messages, but the AudioClips don&#039;t play. Or they play, but they&#039;re empty. Their isReadyToPlay property is perpetually false.

You need to have a co-routine and yield it until it&#039;s done loading...

Weird antennae and relay structures, a lot of vertigo and here and there serene (or would be serene if it wasn&#039;t for the lizards) little sky islands. Plus, cicadas moving around, which is frustrating and fun. Lots of cicada jumping! I have a few memorable moments already, such as entering a cicada hive that&#039;s currently raided by two vultures, and standing at the bottom of a pit with a green lizard getting closer and closer, desperately waiting for my captive cicada to stop being exhausted so I can jump out of there. I got out a split second before the green lizard got me!

Day 1</b></span><br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/djUZk5hl.png" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />YES, all the things that Joar said. I admit to being a little apprehensive about it, as conceptual changes will inevitably scrap a bit of the past couple of years of audio work. But it is necessary! The game has evolved significantly in the past year, and the audio needs to evolve with it.<br /><br /><b>Audio rant below, pls feel free to skip</b><br /><br />One thing thats central to any self-respecting professional audio fascist is aesthetic consistency. For the lingo build, I had a pretty tight concept built around the idea of Rain World as more of a quick, &quot;retro pixel platformer&quot; (remember when people did that?), and so limited the tools used for the audio and SFX to what hardware would have been used for 16bit games. At this point &quot;chiptune&quot; is more of a buzzword and implies a genre more than anything else, so i&#039;ll avoid that and just say that the tools were simple chip-based additive/subtractive synthesis, 2 operator FM, basic wavetable / formant synthesis, and some basic sample / PCM stuff. Nothing that you wouldn&#039;t find in a classic SNES/Neo Geo/Sega CD game. <br /><br />But that was 2 years ago! The game is now modern and sexy with shaders and dynamic lighting and who knows maybe particle effects, so limiting the audio toolkit to 90s tech just doesn&#039;t fit any more, and would be totally arbitrary. I had been anticipating this a bit the past few months and have been experimenting, filling out the sound profile with both hi-fi synthesis elements and manipulating junk audio sources (you might recall that track i posted built from a conversation Joar and I had at PAX), trying to extend the palette in both directions. Might still have to cut a bunch of that old stuff tho! <br /><br />Now, the junk audio thing is funny, because the reason I started messing with that in the context of rain world was because of the SFX samples that Joar was using before I joined the project. As he tells it to me, he just made them with his laptop mic, recording moving papers around and slapping rulers to the table. The resulting sounds are a lot of messy distorted stuff, indistinct white noise elements and compression artifacts. AKA perfect for Rain World! I wouldn&#039;t want to use them raw, but if balanced, eq&#039;d right, run through some nice filters and placed in the proper context, it sounds pretty cool. So I&#039;ve moved to incorporating use of manipulated junk audio throughout the overall audio concept, and am pretty stoked with the results. Imagine you are being hunted through the deep darkness by some huge creature while something like this is playing in the background: <a href="https://clyp.it/jjn25egr" target="_blank">https://clyp.it/jjn25egr</a> Not all the music will be like this of course, but in the right context it creates a pretty amazing mood imho.<br /><br />I dont think Joar was totally on board with this use of his samples initially, but audio is a really interesting medium. if you know what you are doing, you can basically make anything out of anything else. For instance, here is what a korg product rep can do with 1 sample on a cheap hardware sampler in 6 minutes: <br /><iframe width="640" height="385" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/THImd641WXk?fs=1&start=" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br /><br />So basically this entire post so far is me justifying that, yes, I, a &quot;professional sound designer&quot;, will be using Joar&#039;s laptop mic recorded crumpled paper and ruler thwack sounds as audio source material, and its for the sake of aesthetic consistency, LOL<br /><br /><b>/AudioRant, it is now safe to continue reading</b><br /><br />So on to implementation! Past day or so was spent familiarizing myself with Joar&#039;s audio language and establishing a new workflow. Like the rest of my life right now, it is a horrific mess of text files:<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/4XIlrKJl.png" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />But as hellish as it looks, I am super happy with the results so far! My gameplan was to first do an updated version of the Lingo SFX implementation for some practice with the language and to get something to work from. I had expected that to take at least until the weekend, but managed to get a basic sound-set that already sounds significantly better than that in just the afternoon! Super encouraging results.<br /><br />Anyway, I hope that wasn&#039;t TOO boring. The actual audio work itself is literally days of me moving knobs around, so that would be even worse to read! I&#039;ll post some video of this rough audio build tomorrow when I have all the bat sfx triggers sorted out, and post updates on how that evolves through to a more final version.</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/057#1126">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

Its been a strange experience, since most of the tracks associated with the game were done years ago on a lark for what I assumed would be just a little free game. Things have progressed considerably since then, but also I have a lot of comments from people / backers who really like the original tunes, so I&#039;d feel guilty completely scrapping them. They don&#039;t really fit the narrative aspect of the current game so i dont think i&#039;d want them in the single player, but what I might do is have them as tracks available in multiplayer?

This relates to the dynamic audio question as well. The way I have it organized is that there are 3 layers of non-sfx audio, each specific to an individual region: one layer to set the ambiance of a room/sub-region/etc, such as dripping water or machines rumbling softly; another layer that relates dynamically to the weather, so wind, light rain, atmospheric stuff; and the third is tied to narrative elements, game objects or specific moods we want to convey, and that is generally &quot;music&quot; but can also be &quot;music-ish&quot;.<br /><br />the idea is that as you move through the environment, regions, rooms, etc., there is a kind of constantly shifting, blending soundscape around you, and you would rarely (or potentially never) hear the same blend of sounds again. thats the idea at least! all the pieces are there, we just have yet to implement it. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1130377#msg1130377">Quote from: Christian on April 17, 2015, 05:10:11 AM</a></div><div class="quote">Also, &quot;huge creature&quot;...hmm, just an example or a hint of things to come?<br /></div><br />&nbsp;<img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /><br /><br />Anyway, audio stuff is on pause for a day while poor Joar sorts through some bat audio triggers and wraps up the FINAL editor update (fingers crossed!), so I&#039;ve been putting together concepts for the next region: Garbage Wastes!

Also, whereas the physical tiles can only be placed in 3 layers of groupings (0-10, 10-20, 20-30), the prop tiles can be placed at any depth from 0-30, meaning I have much more control of the perception of depth, which will make for a more nuanced look and expanded Three-dimensionality.<br /><br />Anyway enough blurb, Imma get to it!</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/057#1132">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

We just didn&#039;t realize how large the world was going to be back then o_0 We&#039;ve been thinking of the gates as a sort of airlock between regions so they can load and unload. Don&#039;t worry, I don&#039;t expect there to be any loading times to speak of (reading the world text files is usually quicker than a second) but the gates will be there as a room that exists in both region and acts as a transitional area, so that one region can be dropped from RAM and the next one fired up.<br /><br />As for palette changes, we do have a few places where we know we&#039;re going to do a gradual transition (which will eventually culminate in one of those gates, for technical reasons) but for other areas I think it could be kind of cool to have abrupt transitions as well. You go through the gate room, anticipation builds up, and when you pop out on the other side BAM! Everything has changed, an exciting new region to explore.

Realized space is what you see, abstract space is a sort of gross simplification of the game, reduced to basically board game rules, where each room is divided into a few &quot;nodes&quot; that simple representations of creatures occupy and interact in. <br /><br />Abstract space exists to make the world feel alive. Because of the processes in abstract space, you don&#039;t need to move to creatures to &quot;unfreeze&quot; them, they move around in the world according to their own whims and needs, and you might encounter them at any place. Also it keeps track of stuff to make the world feel consistent - stuff such as what creatures are where, what damage state they&#039;re in, etc etc. Basically it is intended to create the experience that the entire world is up and running at the same time.<br /><br />At one point I thought that the entire world was going to be about 100 rooms, and then I entertained the idea of having abstract space loaded for the entire world at once. Now that James has gotten started on the regions though, it turns out that a single region is more or less the size we anticipated the entire world to be. We did a test where we tried to put 4 regions together into one super-region and run it all in abstract space. It worked, but with really bad performance - and we have at least 12 regions planned. <br /><br />So that&#039;s why I&#039;m thinking of loading and unloading the regions from abstract space. I like the abstract space stuff, but mostly because of principle - it&#039;s sort of a simulationist element to the game. Performance, ie the game being able to actually run, is more important. Still I&#039;m not too bummed about it, because if a 60 room region is up and running that is about the scope of simultaneously simulated space that I originally set out to do! The reason why I&#039;m doing the abstract space system is because I want you to be able to follow a creature and see it go about its day, or have a creature follow you. The principal thrill of knowing that a lizard 230 rooms away is actually being simulated is less important than the actual game experience.<br /><br />This said, if I go with the loading/unloading solution I&#039;ll still <i>have </i>to simulate some sort of creature movement in the unloaded areas as well... Because when you enter a region, it won&#039;t do that all creatures are just popping out of their dens even if you&#039;re halfway through a rain cycle. So for that reason, when you go through an area gate the region that is loaded will probably go through some sort of sped-up, simplified version of the standard abstract space simulation, to place creatures in believable positions throughout the region. The same process could be run on all regions during hibernation, so that populations will affect each other etc.<br /><br />Don&#039;t worry about this stuff not being actually simultaneous as the realized rooms, ordinary abstract space isn&#039;t either&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> For this stuff I basically just save what time it was when the abstract entity was last updated, and on the next update weigh that into the simulation.<br /><br />This means that effectively, the game will be divided into three modes rather than two. &quot;Realized space simulation&quot; - the stuff you see on screen, &quot;Abstract space simulation&quot; - the rest of the region you&#039;re in, and &quot;Super abstract space simulation&quot;, the other regions. This basically means that the game is simulated at different resolutions, and the resolution gets higher close to the player - but the game is still to some degree running everywhere else as well.<br /><br />So the individual creatures of the world (which will likely be in the thousands) will all consistently exist, they&#039;ll do stuff, and you&#039;ll be able to find them again (unless they got eaten) but the further away from you they are the more crude the simulation of whatever they&#039;re doing will be. Loading and unloading regions is mostly a technical issue, the implications for your actual gameplay experience is likely not going to be large. With the exception that you&#039;ll have to go through gates in order to move between regions - but the gates was part of the design even before because we want them to cover up the palette changes, so that&#039;s not really a change per se. <br /><br />As for fleeing out of a region to avoid a creature, that&#039;s not really a viable option because the gate rooms have gates, and you don&#039;t want to spend 20 seconds in a tight airlock with a vulture! Also, creatures that are with you in the airlock should be moved to the next region, we need that for other reasons as well (ie pups). On top of that, the regions are large, so it&#039;s probably only in about 5% of the time you&#039;re actually close enough to a region gate for it to be an option. And if you still somehow manage to pull a move like that the gain is not much larger than a standard situation where you manage to go to a new room within the region and have a predator lose you - in common rain world fashion it&#039;s most likely to be out of the frying pan into the fire, with some other beastie waiting for you in the new room you arrive in.</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/057#1136">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

So a room-specific map probably wouldnt even be possible. but if necessary, i could see some sort of vague region map working to preserve the mystery and also not driving players mad. <br /><br />anyway, like so many things, thats a ways away.

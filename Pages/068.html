This one is going to have a lot of palettes and fun custom work, as we plan for it to be kind of the big end-of-game scene and want to spice stuff up quite a bit! Now we are starting to tread some spoiler territory though, and maybe not everything in this region will make it to the devlog as we want you guys to experience it for yourselves.

Actually &quot;quasi 3D&quot; is a pretty good way to describe all the background graphics in the game. The level editor creates 30 bitmaps, each representing a layer in the z-dimension and then bakes them together into a composite which saves the depth value of each pixel. This means that the final image you view could be thought of as a still projection of a crude little voxel space. Most assets are created layer-by-layer and then interpreted by the editor so that they all line up, forming a rough (and very flat) 3d shape.<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/4nDxY.png" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />This is why making new assets takes so long - I can&#039;t just draw them, I have to figure the three dimensional shape out, lay it out as layers, write the instructions for the editor to place everything in the correct layer, etc. <br /><br />When it comes to the actual visual 3D effect, some assets work better than others, and I&#039;m really happy about these chains! However, even the boring boxy assets have a bit of the effect going on. If you look at the chains screenshot you can aaaaaalmost see how on the left hand box, you get a little glimpse of its right face, and on the right hand box you get a little glimpse of the left face.<br /><br />The saved depth value of each pixel is used for basically every shader effect that looks good in the game, that&#039;s like the one magic trick <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0" /> The shadows playing over objects in the background for example are very simple - just fetch the depth of pixel (x,y), depending on that depth step a certain amount of pixels diagonally up/left to say, pixel (x-6, y-8). Once there, check if there is something rendered in the sprite layer at that location - if so, the pixel should be shadowed.</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/068.html#1347">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

This one is going to need a bit of rope physics, which I&#039;m painstakingly trying to figure out. I did try my hand at this with the lantern mouse, but there I could always assume a static base position - here I have to consider both ends of the rope moving as a possibility. <br /><br />I&#039;ve figured out that as long as the rope ends manage their own terrain collision, the rope itself should only have to care about convex corners, which should simplify the task a bit by making the things necessary to think about a lot fewer. <br /><br />I have managed to get something together that works theoretically. In practice though, it&#039;s not perfect yet - sometimes the &quot;sweep&quot; the rope does for corners will miss a corner, and the rope can only create one new bend point in a frame, as well as some other problems. The theory should be sound though, so if I work with it some more I imagine this solution should work.<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/VacantBeneficialAnnelid.gif" alt="" border="0" /></div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/068.html#1350">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

You&#039;ll need to run your own collision code for whatever objects are attached at the ends of the rope, but if that code works and makes sure that the ends are not overlapping terrain when the rope gets its update command it should not clip through any corners or anything.<br /><br />Working with this I kind of felt the inspiration coming on for some kind of touchscreen puzzle game, but any side projects are like 1200 light years from possible now and for the foreseeable future, so if anyone else is interested I&#039;d be happy to hand it over&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0" /></div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/068.html#1355">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

The effect is similar, but I think the algorithmic approach is more different than same. As you see in the gif, my rope thing can wrap several times around the same object, cross itself etc. The convex hull algorithm is about mathematically finding the perimeter of an object - it&#039;s a way more &quot;mathematically clean&quot; line. For example they mention that one of the definitions of their line is that every angle is a left turn, &nbsp;that certainly doesn&#039;t go for my line haha!<br /><br />My approach is less pure maths, more hands on. Whenever a rope segment moves (and it&#039;s only the first and the last rope segments that can move) I sweep over the area it covered in its movement and check all the corner points in there. The corner point that is closest to where the segment was before it started to move is picked as the position for a new bend on the rope.</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/068.html#1356">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

The concave points (such as the one in that crevice on the shape in your sketch) there&#039;s really no reason to bother with at all, because as long as the tips of the rope have terrain collision those can never end up inside a sweep.<br /><br />@Christian, TheWing, yep, 45 unless you hold up, then straight up. And a little bit of auto aim - if the original aim direction seems to be all empty of terrain it&#039;ll check a few angles to the sides as well and see if any of those hit something.<br /><br />@Paul, wow yeah, that looks super similar!

I actually <i>did </i>spend too much time swinging around once I implemented the thing, so I had to remove the player from the development room to be able to continue hahaha :D <br /><br />@JobLeonard, yup exactly, when hitting a corner I split the rope in two at that point and then apply the same logic on both the new segments recursively - stepping down in a tree like way until all the intersecting points have been handled. I actually only calculate distance for the points that are inside the sweep area, but what points are inside the sweep area is determined using a triangle/point overlap which calls the line/point distance <i>three </i>times haha &nbsp;<img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0" /> So yeah... <br /><br />Working with Rain World has made me become pragmatic rather than idealistic when it comes to optimization - usually all attempts at optimization of stuff like this are utterly soaked by some pathfinding line that is called 14 000 times per frame, outweighing anything that could or couldn&#039;t be done differently in a thing like this astronomically. So I&#039;ve started to gravitate towards writing the easiest, cleanest solution, and then <i>if </i>there is a performance problem optimize it. So far, no problem with performance! Most rooms seem to have less than 100 convex corners anyways, so it blazes through those pretty quickly. If I were to optimize however, I&#039;d take out the tiles that are affected by the sweep and find the corner points in there frame by frame. As most swipes are probably very small and not overlapping any corners that&#039;d likely save some time. For a non-tile based situation like your sketch you could divide the space into sections and only check the points in the affected sections.<br /><br />I do think that the convex hull algorithm could be useful as an optimization in a non-tile based scenario, but it would have to be complemented by something, as not every convex vertex is necessarily part of the convex hull:<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/VL5Sc.png" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />@Christian, no comments&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/whome.gif" alt="Who, Me?" border="0" /> Yet&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/whome.gif" alt="Who, Me?" border="0" /></div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/068.html#1358">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

Again, if not, please consider. </div><br />Most of the fundamental mechanics of Rain World are built around the core idea of the player creature being at the center of an ecological triangle as both predator and prey. Through that we&#039;re able to explore the concept of resource scarcity on a micro and macro scale through the narrative design, the world design and down through the gameplay, etc. What happens when an ecology of creatures (or civilizations) are forced to compete for a pool of dwindling resources in a world with a climate dangerously out of whack? I want the player to feel the existential pressures of this, the bleak prospect of comfort and even survival slipping further and further out of reach as time goes by, not through &quot;enemies&quot; or &quot;bad guys&quot; but only due to the consequences of the player characters basic needs for survival and the natural self-preservation behaviors of those around it. For me, thats the thesis of the game and something i feel very strongly about conveying, for reasons that should be fairly obvious.<br /><br />That said, I really like the idea of the game not forcing a players hand, allowing the game to be playable in a variety of ways provided they fit the criteria of the central game mechanics of &quot;get sufficient food&quot; and &quot;survive rain cycle&quot;. These are &quot;emergent narrative paths&quot; that open up based on how the player naturally approaches the game and i&#039;d like to support and encourage them where possible. &quot;Vegan Slugcat&quot; is hard because it compromises a good deal of teh structure already in place, but if things work out in a certain way it could *possibly* be explored as an achievement path later in the polish phase. But other than the necessary sustenance it should currently def be possible to get through the game as a pacifist using entirely stealth and misdirection. In fact, Joar even has a system in place to reward altruistic behavior, though we&#039;ll keep quiet on the specifics of it for now. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1173051#msg1173051">Quote from: tortoiseandcrow on August 26, 2015, 12:12:34 PM</a></div><div class="quote">Note: from my experience of the alpha, it is entirely possible to play the game without purposelessly killing other animals. In fact, it is appropriately difficult (often impossible) to just run around murdering all of the predators hunting you.<br /></div><br />This is def a key element as well. Its not fleshed out yet, but there is also a system in place where the more aggressively you play, the more aggressive the creatures around you become. If you kill weaker creatures, it opens up their ecological niche to other more dangerous creatures, etc. Plays to both the thesis of the game and creates a challenging &quot;warrior&quot; emergent narrative path, etx etx.<br /><br />A lot of this stuff is really &quot;balance focused&quot;, so nothing were touching right now and very subject to change. Plenty of work to do just getting the core game and geography in place.</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/068.html#1359">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

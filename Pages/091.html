We present to you patch #1: Rain World v1.01</b><br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/uXfvAPO.png" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />This quick patch is intended to accommodate some early player feedback and polish assorted rough edges on the various game systems, etc. These were all low-hanging fruit that we think improves the player experience without taking anything away from the concept of the game. Rain World should be an existential experience: unforgiving and even occasionally unfair. But it should be the jaws of a Lizard that gets you or the Rain, not some ragdoll physics wonk or design oversight!<br /><br />Gameplay improvements:<br />* “stuck in holes” fix - disconnected exits will no longer snag you<br />* subtle backlit slugcat in low visibility swimming situations<br />* quicker turning around in tunnels<br />* larger lung capacity while swimming<br />* nerfed the more intense waterfalls in Shoreline to prevent repeated drownings<br />* more pearls near Scav tolls in Garbage Wastes<br />* more food in central Garbage Wastes<br />* more food in central Shaded Citadel<br />* more karma flowers in world<br />* karma gate requirements on the Shaded Citadel, Drainage System and Underhang side were lowered to prevent players becoming stuck in challenging regions<br />* food / karma flowers regeneration now ticks forward on deaths (helps eliminate stuck / starvation situations at low karma)<br />* players will now keep map progress between deaths (Id say 99.5% of people asked for this)<br />* map now features gate karma symbols and shelter icons when locations are discovered<br />* karma depletion on game exit removed if done within 30 seconds of sleep cycle<br />* full karma drop on exit bug fixed (that was a brutal one, sheesh!)<br />* intro cinematic is now skippable by holding start / esc<br />* for players having issues with Grey Screen of Death and starting the game from sav files, you can now entirely skip loading the into by holding &quot;s&quot; when pressing &quot;New Game.&quot; hopefully this helps until we have a real fix!<br />* many many minor room fixes<br /><br />Stability improvements:<br />* map loading bug fixed (was causing the corrupted savs, ugh)<br />* gate crashing bug fixed<br />* stability improvements<br /><br />etc.<br /><br />Next steps: More patches and content is on the way, of course! We would like to see how this current round of bugfixes land before digging into further issues, as we have a feeling that these might solve a lot of the problems we&#039;ve seen. But of course if you could keep sending in those bug reports and sav files that would be fantastic and hugely beneficial.<br /><br />Thanks to all for feedback and please keep it coming! Let&#039;s all get through this tedious fixing and tweaking so we can get rolling on the fun stuff: new content!<br /><br />&lt;3<br />--Rain World team</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/091#1801">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

I think we&#039;ll make that an option when we do our proper update.

On the fall-through platforms, you can tap down once to get into the crouching position - from there you can either hold jump to leap, or tap down again to fall through the platform. On smaller platforms, you can tap down quickly (not hold) to get into the crouching position, and then leap from there (although this is definitely a little finicky and something we&#039;ll look into!)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">-controls which constantly let you roll down ledges,when you try to duck in a pipe on a Floating platform,because for some strange reason slucgat sometimes tends to do a barrel roll of the ledge, when you duck instead of going into the pipe you want to duck into. </div>Accidental rolling fixed in this patch!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">+The transition of slugcat between horizontal poles and vertical poles on their crossing lines is slow and clunky as hell! </div> <br />Noted, will look into!

Basically the map in the release version just wasnt working how we intended. Part of the function was to allow players to track their location and plan routes, etc, like a map does. But the other essential part was to show players where they HADNT been, so when they wanted to explore new territory they would know where to start.<br /><br />We had thought that having the map progress be lost upon death would do this, but in fact when watching streamers play it seemed to have the opposite effect! Since the game is quite challenging, players were only really able to save their map progress along main lines through regions, and when they&#039;d explore side paths they&#039;d die and lose whatever cartographic progress they had made. So then when you look at the map its basically just a straight line going from region gate to gate. Not at all what we were intending!<br /><br />Saving the map progress through death allows for the progress along side paths and etc to remain, which i think is a much better indication of &quot;path not explored&quot; than what was happening before. So all in all i think its a solid improvement!</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/091#1804">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

Thanks for the heads up!<br /><br />The idea with the echoes is that you won&#039;t get a good look at them - keeps it mysterious and your mind fills in the blanks with cooler stuff than I would be able to deliver <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0" /></div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/091#1817">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

I say with mods, don&#039;t worry too much about canon - the fun is in making up your own stuff right? That said you&#039;re of course welcome to tell what you had in mind. As for twelve new regions... Good luck soldier&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/shocked.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /><br /><br />@jprosk, yup, you going in the direction of the thing you throw is physically incorrect. It... felt right though, to have slugcat sort of lean into the throw.<br /><br />@Manray, the sky centipedes are always sort of the same size.<br /></div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/091#1818">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

I&#039;m doing some multiplayer stuff (basically an arena mode) and difficulty modes. The idea for the difficulty modes is that you&#039;ll be able to select a slugcat to play as, and they&#039;ll come with a few different perks and/or slight variations to the world. For the first update I&#039;m gonna do 3 of them ~ Yellow (easy), White(normal) and Red(hard). White will ofc be just like the current game, whereas the other two have slight variations. <br /><br />Here&#039;s Red carrying an extra spear on its back:<br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/NeedyMagnificentChick.gif" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />The extra spear goes outside of the two &quot;slots&quot; of the hands, meaning that you can have it simultaneously as carrying two other objects (and potentially a fourth one in your tummy). The spear is stashed and retrieved similarly to how you swallow stuff, but requires a significantly shorter button hold. I think there should perhaps be some more animation to the slugcat&#039;s arms when putting/retrieving the spear, will get to that later today.<br /><br />This is a pretty significant boon to the player, but don&#039;t worry, playing as Red will be very very challenging! Red is basically for the action-oriented players, and you&#039;ll need that extra spear.<br /><br />Playing as Yellow on the other hand is going to make your life easier in a bunch of ways compared to White. </div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/091#1819">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div><br></body>

Since its super time-consuming to do and purely cosmetic we had kind of abandoned hope of making it a part of the slick new Rain World, so didnt talk about it much other than attempts to squeeze some tests in occasionally when there was a second of down-time. But now we have a few weeks that we cant touch the code while the PS4 porting then testing finishes up and the games off being localized, so Joar has been able to dive into tagging up all my lovely austere surfaces&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0" /><br /><br />It&#039;s looking awesome though and really adds back an important flavor to the world.

Del is rushing rushing rushing to get through a seemingly unending list of illustration work from us. we&#039;ve gotten so much feedback thats basically &quot;the illustrations are amazing, there should be more of them&quot;, so were trying to get as much in as possibly before this last deadline. With the holidays and post election depression its been a struggle though.<br /><br />anyway, the grind continues! we&#039;ll be showing rain world at the playstation experience (PSX) in a week, and should have a shiny new RW trailer for that, as well as some other fun stuff. cheers friends, hope you are all well!&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/toast-r.gif" alt="Toast Right" border="0" /></div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/086#1712">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

Yeah we have co-op built in but it&#039;s going to come later as an update, as we need time to work out some specifics with the implementation. Same for the head-to-head multiplayer.<br /><br />Finbonne: I&#039;d love to ask you some questions, as we&#039;ve had like zero player feedback on the co-op. You&#039;re managing to have fun even with the camera only tracking player 1? And how do you handle the room switches? Just wait for the other player to show up before moving on? Literally any info about what you like / don&#039;t like about it will be super helpful.<br /><br />We could implement it super quickly as it currently&nbsp; is, having it as a looser &quot;sonic and tales&quot; style co-op where the other player can drift off screen and then warp them in to nearby room exits if they get too far, or perhaps require both players to be in an exit to move rooms. We have also talked about attempting a proper dynamic split screen, when the screens split and recombine, allowing a more serious co-op play-style, but it creates a ton of other problems to solve and might wind up way too CPU intensive with all the shaders that would have to be duplicated onscreen. Plus it doesn&#039;t REALLY work with how the significant game events happen, so idk that might be out at this point. Either way it&#039;ll take some fiddling!<br /><br /></div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/086#1717">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

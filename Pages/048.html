I just can&#039;t seem to make it work properly... And it&#039;s extremely cognitively exhausting all the time. I really thought I was on the final stretch this morning, but that&#039;s 6 hours ago and I&#039;m still not happy with what I have.<br /><br />If anybody has some tutorial, or some tips, or some anything, please please let me know!<br /><br />This is what I&#039;m attempting to accomplish: Basically super rudimentary rope physics. If the rope sweeps over an island of terrain, it shouldn&#039;t be allowed to pass through. The segments of the rope should not be allowed to exist on different sides of a wall - basically the entire rope should be connected in non-solid tiles from start to end. <br /><br />What I have is <i>almost </i>good enough. In some situations it actually looks okay. In some situations when the tentacle moves around an obstacle it moves so quickly that it looks as if it&#039;s sweeping right through, which kind of defeats the purpose.<br /><br />Functionally it&#039;s pretty solid, it&#039;s finding paths and have a fixed reach etc. But cosmetically I find it unappealing, the movement is super jerky.

I don&#039;t exactly get what you&#039;re saying about pulling in limbs? I do get that it would be pretty simple to have a tentacle that just contracts and then extends along a new path. It could just make itself longer along the path, and when a new path is found it could easily use its own body as a path home, and then get started on the next path. Problem is that if the base of the tentacle is moving, such as in this case, it&#039;d be always contracted. So I need something that rather tries to align with a path in real time.<br /><br />@zorg, I pretty much need to animate it all, because the tip and the base of the tentacle are moving simultaneously. But that&#039;s not the problem really - the problem is terrain, or more specifically corners. When the rope is pushed against a corner the segments go separate ways, and end up on different sides of some terrain feature, which causes the rope to get stuck.<br /><br /><b>Update 382</b><br /><br />I think I actually solved it to a degree that&#039;s far from perfect, but which I&#039;m decently happy with. As marcgfx mentioned, we&#039;re hoping for the skinning of the character to make it look better still.<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/SM6Jg.gif" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />Sometimes the solution was super obvious and sitting there all along. Not so this time. Every part of functionality in this thing was hard won through hours of blood, sweat and tears.<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/I2wN.png" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />My head is all dizzy from all the actual freaking <i>thinking </i>I&#039;ve had to do to get to this somewhat okay-ish result.<br /><br />Contrary to being obvious my solution is even hard to explain. Hmm. <br /><br />Okay, so you see that there&#039;s a semi-transparent &quot;ghost&quot; tentacle? That&#039;s the tile space tentacle. It has pros and cons. Pros - it can never be inside terrain, and the segments are always neighbors, meaning the whole thing is connected from root to tip, in non-solid tiles. Cons - it&#039;s square looking and lack physics features such as gravity. But most notably, when the path changes, it tends to curl up and get really small before extending along the path again. <br /><br />Then there&#039;s the float space tentacle, which are the round segments. The idea is basically that the float space tentacle should do it&#039;s thing, looking cool and physicsy, but also draw from the strengths of the tile space tentacle (which is, as we remember, <i><b>not getting stuck in terrain all the goddamn time</b></i>).<br /><br />Each float space segment has a buddy in the tile space tentacle, as indicated by the little purple lines. If the float space buddy can see its tile space buddy, it&#039;s pretty much free to float around.<br /><br />If not, the float space buddy has been keeping track of every position of its tiles space buddy, like, 60 ticks back. So then it starts to go backwards in that list and raytracing to check if it can see those last positions. The first one it can see, it moves towards.<br /><br />This means that the float space tentacle generally does its thing, except when it can&#039;t see its tile space counterpart. In that case it starts to follow like, the ghost of its tile space counterpart, until it catches up. That&#039;s why you can see the float space tentacle kind of mimic the movement of the tile space tentacle, but a little bit delayed, as an obstacle is avoided.<br /><br />Pew.</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/048.html#943">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

The &quot;ghost&quot; tentacle, with its curls and swoops, almost seems more natural in its movements than the &quot;real&quot; tentacle following that pathing. I wonder if increasing the tension and decreasing the elasticity of the connections between the pathing ghost and the tentacle nodes would resolve the clumping issue. Right now it definitely looks like it is being pulled, rather than muscular movement.<br /><br />Also AAAAAAAAAAH that thing is way longer than I anticipated! I really hope that there will be extensive, maze-like warrens of tunnels to hide in when that thing is around...<br /></div>I also agree, the ghost tentacle looks better.

Like, seriously, haha.<br /><br />I think the only thing you might want to do is reverse how the tentacle is moving toward the goal position - instead of attempting to move the tip to the desired position, it seems like it&#039;d be easier to move the root of the tentacle to the desired root point of the path, and then move on to the next node in the tentacle. Repeat until all nodes of the tentacle are close enough to the goal. That way, you won&#039;t have so much weird &quot;ghosting through objects&quot; and doubling back on the tip, since it&#039;s going from the root forward. <br /><br />But I dunno, that might be what you&#039;ve tried already, or maybe it won&#039;t work well.<br /><br />Great work, anyway!<br /></div><br />This is pretty much the movement pattern of the &quot;ghost tentacle&quot;.

The purple tentacles are passive, so it&#039;d have to be the wings if any. It does reach with its neck though, but it&#039;s not very long.

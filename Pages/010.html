Sometimes I want their colors to change slightly to align with a color in the specific level&#039;s palette. For example, if one level has pink plants in it I want the pink lizards on that level to be <i>that </i>pink, not anything else. This is kind of a hassle in some cases, as some parts of the lizards are constituted of bitmaps loaded from memory, and for those parts the colors can&#039;t be changed from the code. So I&#039;m doing multiple sets of those parts so that everything will be in sync.</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/010#180">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

I attract the attention of the croc, and make it follow me. When the croc see me dissapear down the ledge it assumes I dropped to the bottom, and decides to drop down as well. Once down there it realizes that was not the case, and crawls back up to investigate where I might have gone. My friend is waiting for it with the spear.<br /><br />This is of course an artifical situation, but it shows how the semi-predictable AI can affect the way you play. It&#039;s possible to make a plan based on what you&#039;d think be a reasonable behaviour for the croc, and put it in motion. Not all plans will work as smoothly as this one of course, but I hope there will be fun in the element of surprise as well!</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/010#182">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

A lizard will now behave reasonably if you steal its egg, and the AI seems to not mess upp too much (from what I&#039;ve seen so far). <br /><br />If you steal an egg, the lizard will hunt you down and kill you, but let go and take the egg home first. Then it will return for your body. If you drop the egg to the ground the lizard will prioritize the egg over you, and you&#039;re safe a little while. If you snatch the egg from a lizard that&#039;s carrying it you&#039;re pretty much instantly dead though, as it&#039;ll just snap at you the very moment you snatch the egg. When carrying eggs they have their mouths slightly open, meaning that you don&#039;t even have the few frames it ordinarily takes for a surprised lizard to open its jaws before it can snap at you. A lizard always knows where its egg is, even though it can&#039;t see it. A psychic radio connection? Idk... But if they didn&#039;t, it would be way too easy to get away with an egg, as it is now it at least poses some kind of risk and challenge.<br /><br />You don&#039;t need to press the &quot;pick up&quot;-button to get an egg from a hole, entering the hole without carrying anything in your hands will pick up the egg automatically.<br /></div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/010#191">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

It&#039;s not what I had in mind for the eggs though - the eggs will work as a single player collectable. I&#039;m planning to have a sandbox gametype where you can spawn whatever lizards you want, if you&#039;ve collected their egg in single player mode. And maybe there&#039;ll be an &quot;egg hunt&quot; gametype as well, where there are no flies and the players compete to steal eggs from the lizards. Apart from all this the eggs will be worth some food points, they&#039;ll equal to 4 or 5 flies, or whatever seems reasonable.<br /><br />James, what about the bubble creatures?

Knowing that there&#039;s some anticipation out there certainly helps me catching my breath when it seems I&#039;m out of it.<br /><br /><b>Update 123</b><br />James got inspired from the new levels, and made new music! Two new tracks of the same high standard as always. These tracks are a bit more background-ish according to me, so I think I&#039;ll try to fit them into the hub world areas. They could also work as a suspenceful background for a level with many not-too-dangerous lizards where the action is kind of even in intesity.<br /><br />On my end I&#039;ve been tampering a bit with the world map, and I also solved a problem where it would instantly transport you two rooms instead of just one upon entering a door. I went with an ugly solution, blocking the second of the double signals instead of finding the source for it and removing it.

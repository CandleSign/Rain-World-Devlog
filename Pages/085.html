Any new insights or developments?<br /></div><br />Hallo friends! Doing pretty well, thanks for asking~<br /><br />It&#039;s been intense on top of intense the past few weeks, but extremely productive. 2 weeks ago Lydia and I flew down to Adult Swim HQ in Atlanta for a solid week of testing, which was very enlightening. <br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/ajHzcVN.jpg" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />The way it worked was that we had 2 sessions a day with groups of players who hadn&#039;t played the game before, and we observed how they handled the first 40 or so minutes of gameplay. They&#039;d fill out questionnaires before hand about their experience as a gamer and then afterwards about what they liked / didnt like about the game, what was challenging, what didnt make sense, etc., and then we&#039;d sit around and talk about it for a bit. Then at night, I would take the feedback to Joar (who was still in Sweden naturally) and we&#039;d attempt to iterate a new build that solved some of the problems to test for the NEXT day, etc etc. <br /><br />In early testing people always liked the art, mood, characters and sound, but generally found themselves frustrated by aspects or didn&#039;t understand what was going on, or often felt like the game was unfair. Even after playing the tutorial, it seemed to be an issue of the players not understanding how the various mechanics of the game fit together. <br /><br />This was a little surprising and humbling for us because we have been showing the game for a long time, both among friends and with new players at conventions like PAX, E3, etc etc., (for years!) and observed people to generally pick it up pretty well. But what seemed to be the X factor at work here was that in those contexts for new players we&#039;d always be standing right there chatting with the player beforehand, and just giving a super brief description when handing them the controller (&quot;its a survival game where you play as this lost creature, have to catch food to survive, rain cycles, etc etc&quot;) was enough to give them the tools to piece together the various mechanics. And obviously a person playing the game blind in a test or downloading it from Steam or whatever, wouldn&#039;t have that. <br /><br />And most importantly we had to realize that it wasn&#039;t that &quot;its just not a game for everybody&quot; (as we&#039;d sometimes let ourselves off the hook with), it was actually that we were failing to give players the tools they needed to play the game. NOTHING is worse than watching in front of you someone who is really excited and enthusiastic about your game become frustrated and disillusioned, when 2 seconds worth of text hints or a controller diagram pop up would clarify everything. <br /><br />So we had to fix all that. It was intense and stressful! I was working practically 24hrs a day for a good part of the week. But the results were nothing less than paradigm shifting and improved the new player experience (and i&#039;d say the game in general) tremendously. Over the course of the week the tester surveys went from &quot;looks beautiful, but is frustrating or i dont understand&quot; to &quot;i love this, can i play more, when does it come out, let me know if you need deeper testing&quot;, which is *extremely rewarding* <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/tearsofjoy.gif" alt="Tears of Joy" border="0" /><br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/fumNxdh.jpg" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />And after getting back from that we&#039;ve been applying all that we learned from the testing sessions and sprinting to our upcoming <span style="background-color: red;">gold date!</span> Joar has been heroically slaying bugs, polishing gameplay and UI stuff, adding in new features to tie everything up; Del is somehow slogging through an impossible list of illustrations, and im tidying up levels, music, audio and organizing some last bits of deeper testing this week. <br /><br />Anyway, we *really really* appreciate you guys still posting and checking in, staying enthusiastic even as we have been mute codeslaves for the past months, too exhausted from the pixel mines to make posts. This will change soon though! The light at the end of the tunnel is so bright I almost feel like Im outside!!! </div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/085#1680">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

(Obviously I&#039;m not expecting full chamber-music dynamics, but perhaps something in the vein of Disasterpeace&#039;s <a href="http://music.disasterpeace.com/album/hyper-light-drifter" target="_blank">exquisitely rendered official score</a> to <i>Hyper Light Drifter</i>, because believe it or not, from what I&#039;ve heard thus far your music really does warrant the extra attention.)<br /><br />Thanks in advance, and keep up your truly world-class endeavour in all departments!<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />- Ryan<br /></div><br />Most certainly! The soundtrack at this point is absurdly long, like 3.5hr+, a good deal of which is music that is setup in layers for dynamic audio, or other game context dependent format. So after everything is settled with development&nbsp; i really want to take some time and get everything cleaned up, organized or arranged into proper listenable tracks (so it sounds like a song rather than 12 layers of loops that interact etc), and see how it can be grouped into a few albums worth of music.<br /><br />We&#039;ve had a few companies come to us with concepts for doing nice vinyl editions and I&#039;d really like to pursue that as well, though 3.5 hours of vinyl is a LOT of vinyl, so might break it down into a few different self contained volumes or something.

In addition to continuing to wrap up the dev work, right now Joar is moving to Seoul, South Korea (after spending a week showing RW at Busan Indie Connect, where it was nominated for excellence in Art, Sound and the Grand Prixe prize!) while I&#039;ve been showing the game at PAX West in Seattle (where it was shown at 3 locations: Adult Swim, Sony and Sanshee) and then the XOXO Fest Arcade in Portland for the past 2 weeks. <br /><br />I think something that&#039;s lost on these boards and even in documentaries like indie game the movie etc is just how many roles you have to take up as an indie developer. There may have been a time when someone could code a game in their basement and release it on steam the next day and that would do well, but it is definitely not the case now. Pretty much every indie budget game that I&#039;ve seen succeed the past few years has been accompanied by tireless promotional work. I was talking about this with Joar yesterday, how there&#039;s basically this unspoken under-culture of devs as &quot;marketing nomads&quot; going from convention to convention perpetually, in different states and countries,&nbsp; exposing a game to new audiences, making journalists aware of it, building support from various communities, etc etc. It&#039;s like running a political campaign or something! But if you&#039;ve spent years of your life and all of your savings account developing a game, you can&#039;t take the risk of just throwing it out there and hoping for the best.<br /><br />Outside of the traveling circus of the industry I don&#039;t think anyone is really aware of it. Like, the average person might go to a convention and see a dev there with their game and assume &quot;oh cool, they are at this convention&quot;, but the truth is that they are at EVERY convention, and they probably have been for months or years, writing code in the hotel room, sending emails on shitty Starbucks wifi. This goes for the most polished indie darling to the roughest unity asset flip. Kind of fascinating, really. Even devs that are considered to be &quot;reclusive&quot; by the online gaming&nbsp; community I see regularly at these events, working hard. Phil Fish was at XOXO, Tarn Adams was at BIC, etc etc<br /><br />And as an indie you are doing this with a very small team of course, so long story short sometimes we&#039;re not reading too deeply into the TIGS comments, or will forego responding to questions that are answered elsewhere in the thread&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/gentleman.gif" alt="Gentleman" border="0" /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />As for the alpha that&#039;s on humble, the link is legit but it is **OLD** and not in any way representative of the current game, so I personally would only recommend it to people who might be interested in following the development process in some depth. It might be interesting for people like Christian and Chris Early who have played the Lingo alpha years ago, then this early C# build and then get to see how the mechanics evolve into the final game, but likely not to the average player.<br /><br />And lastly: shoutout to the TIGS fam for holding down the threads while we&#039;ve been away, answering questions, etc. Y&#039;all are the best&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/hand-metal-r.gif" alt="Hand Metal Right" border="0" /><br /><br /><br /></div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/085#1690">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

In our minds Rainworld has been pretty overhyped and media saturated, so we have been consciously making an effort to downplay things the past months until we do the official release date / trailer and all of that (hence the lack of new footage, etc etc.) We dont want the game to come out and people to be like &quot;ah yes, its rainworld, which looks like it has for the past 5 years&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />But that said we are still obligated to show the game and be present for conventions and events, which carries its own natural hype. Similarly, if a journalist gets in touch and wants to do a thing of course we&#039;re not going to tell them &quot;no&quot;, that would be idiotic. But we also havent been actively seeking it out, if that makes sense. Though soon enough we will be! And we have 8 months of flashy progress to show, so im pretty excited for that.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1281170#msg1281170">Quote from: kennoley on September 12, 2016, 01:59:07 PM</a></div><div class="quote"><b> *If I buy the alpha I will get the final version of the game when it comes out?* </b><br /></div><br />yes! though probably only on Steam.

Things are looking REAL NICE <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/eyebrows.gif" alt="Well, hello there!" border="0" /><br /><br />Its pretty crazy though: Joar is in Seoul right now, Carbon is in London, and Adult Swim is in Atlanta. Im in Boston organizing everything, and never sleeping because as soon as one crew calls it a day another timezone day begins! But everything is moving along quite nicely.<br /><br />For international peeps, its official that we&#039;ll be releasing in a few languages: English, French, Italian, German, Spanish and Portuguese; which im very very excited about. I never expected things to get this big. <br /><br />We plan on doing Asian languages eventually, but localization is going to take quite a bit for that and we&#039;ll have to redo our text system to accommodate, so it&#039;ll be down the line a bit. <br /><br /><br /><br />Another cool thing now that content production is wrapped up is that I can start focusing on PR/media stuff. <br /><br />For some that sounds like dirty words I know, but what I mean by it is putting together cool media to tease on the lead up to release. Were planning on a bunch of trailers showcasing different regions, gif campaigns that follow little narratives, &quot;music videos&quot; showcasing some of our favorite tunes in context, wallpapers and teaser art from Del. Super super psyched to get into all of that! (Especially since the last few months have been a tedious bug-testing hellscape, haha!)<br /><br />But anyway, if anybody has things they&#039;d like to see or suggestions for that let me know and I&#039;ll take it into consideration!&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/toast-r.gif" alt="Toast Right" border="0" /><br /><br /></div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/085#1694">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

I say &quot;speed run&quot; it in quotes because the fastest I, the person who made every room and region and know all the secrets and shortcuts, have been able to play to the win condition (skipping 3 regions!) is 8hrs. And that is ignoring all the narrative stuff and endgame content ofc.<br /><br />ASG has people testing as well, but since a lot of this stuff is making sure that some shader effect in room 1367 is the right color and transparency, or this audio layer lines up with 4 others in the right way, its basically only me that can do it. So I run the game over and over every day as they update the builds, taking screenshots and video of the problems and sending it to them to tweak. this is my punishment for ambition!<br /><br />but yeah as soon as this nightmare is over its time to update the fans and let them know the good news: rain world is coming...</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/085#1697">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

I hope to be able to go back to it and fix it up a little bit at some point for sure. The game only has like, 3 menu screens though, and in the standard case your only interaction with it will be hitting &quot;continue&quot; in the main menu, so it&#039;s a super minor part of the game. The button is big because it&#039;s a safety button - you can&#039;t click it but need to hold it and a white semi-circle will fill in gradually. </div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/085#1699">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div><br></body>

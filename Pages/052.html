Love this sort of devlog interactivity&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/grin.gif" alt="Grin" border="0" /> <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/hand-shake-r.gif" alt="Hand Shake Right" border="0" /><br /><br />The *= .99 was actually added by me, for exactly the reason you mention <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0" /> I know the solution could be more slimmed, but actually the code I posted here was cleaned up, in my actual implementation I&#039;m saving some other stuff as well for the surface points, why I&#039;m keeping them as classes.<br /><br />@Prinsessa, looking good! Really interesting to see how you use a different method to achieve a similar result. When you&#039;re done tinkering I&#039;m sure we&#039;re all eager to know the result, <i>is Gabe a witch? </i>&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/whome.gif" alt="Who, Me?" border="0" /><br /><br /><b>Update 402</b><br /><br />Lizard infighting! This has taken the entire day, but I think I&#039;m getting somewhere. The actual animation, i.e. how the lizards move, still needs polish, but the more general behavior seems solid enough. <br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/UntidyImmediateAmurminnow.gif" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />Basically it goes like this - the lizards have an AgressiveRival relationship towards each other, of varying intensity. They&#039;re mostly aggressive towards others of the same breed. As they move around, they can get annoyed with each other, because of various reasons. If they&#039;re very aggressive, just because the other is too close, otherwise in situations such as the other being too close to the prey they&#039;re hunting, and in particular when they bump into each other and block each others&#039; path.<br /><br />If the annoyance goes high enough so that it&#039;s picked by the utility comparer, a Fight behavior is initiated. As this is mostly a display of dominance it&#039;s not really as much fighting as hissing, but if they end up in a narrow space it might get ugly. <br /><br />When fighting, the lizard has a chance each frame to to send out a signal. I&#039;ve set up a rudimentary system for inter-lizard communication, right now there are only two types of signals Aggressive and Submissive. The angrier the lizard is, the more Agressive signals it&#039;s sending to the other. On receiving an Aggressive signal, the receiving lizard&#039;s annoyance is also incremented, making it more likely to return the Aggressive signals, and that way the conflict escalates. However, there&#039;s also a small chance upon receiving an Aggressive signal to return a Submissive signal.<br /><br />When a lizard sends a Submissive signal, the conflict is de-escalated, and the submissive individual gets tasked with leaving the room. For this I had to set up a new AI module called Mission Tracker, which will come in handy for a lot of stuff. The Mission Tracker can basically keep track of a bunch of tasks an AI entity has set out to do, such as travelling somewhere, or maybe in the future to hunt down a specific individual, search a specific room, or similar. The Mission has a utility, and if something happens to the lizard with a higher utility the mission can be dormant for a while, and then continued later. This means that now a lizard can for example be headed somewhere, but be interrupted by a threat, flee for a little while, and then when it&#039;s safe continue its Mission.<br /><br />At the moment there&#039;s just one Mission implemented, which is to get out of a room. When the mission is activated a neighboring room is chosen, and the lizard starts to move there. Actually it tries to move two rooms away if possible, which will scatter the lizards all over the world to James&#039; delight haha! James is generally trying to shape the play experience with level design, but my unpredictable critters tend to get in the way of that&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0" /> Maybe if it&#039;s too crazy I&#039;ll have to take a step back on that.<br /><br />Anyhow, all of this basically boils down to a pretty simple behavior - the lizards will hang out, but occasionally get annoyed with each other, do a lot of hissing and maybe a little fighting, until one of them decides to scram with its tail between its legs. Hope this interactivity will make the game feel more dynamic and fun.</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/052.html#1025">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

Keep in mind that we&#039;re doing two things here, we&#039;re making a terrarium-like thing for sure, but also a game, so we are going to use some tools to shape the experience. For example it&#039;s more fun to encounter lizards in actual rooms rather than narrow corridors and stuff like that, and it also makes more sense for them to hang out there, which is why we&#039;re going to have them gravitate towards certain areas. Once that happens though, the dominance struggle will set in and some of them might have to settle for less attractive territories. <br /><br />When it comes to the actual nutrition web part of the ecosystem, we&#039;re not doing that. There might be some starvation-like mechanism down the road, probably manifested in an increasing desperation for food, but we&#039;re not aiming to make a proper simulation of an ecosystem - it would just not be possible to keep it stable, and the effort would be humongous with really no payout in terms of player experience. As a scientific research project or something I&#039;d love to go down that road, but here we&#039;re aiming to create an experience rather than an accurate simulation.<br /><br />@AxezDNyde thanks! The refraction stuff is a little detail in the shader, the idea was that it was supposed to make stuff look wet, but I don&#039;t really know if it accomplished that haha! It still makes the environment looks more dynamic and alive though, so it&#039;ll stick around <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0" /><br /><br />@Christian, yup, they have different degrees of aggression towards members of the same breed and members of other breeds.

When the individual treats come around that will weight into it as well, some individuals might be more aggressive etc. In general this system could need some refinement, with separate parameters for a bunch of stuff, but it seems good enough for now!<br /><br />@DarkWanderer, yeah there is occasional actual biting and stuff. Particularly if they end up fighting in a very enclosed area it might get bad. The white lizards actually won&#039;t be eating the blues, that was just a mocked up situation for fun. But in general, yeah, they have some knowledge about who&#039;s bigger, and they should be taking that into account even more as the system gets a little polish.</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/052.html#1026">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

Like if one tries to wrestle and the other tries to do something else. These behaviors can obviously be given endless polish, and maybe we&#039;ll go there, but not right now. Whites flashing colors at each other is a totally awesome idea though, and really easy, so I&#039;m definitely adding that&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/hand-thumbsup-r.gif" alt="Hand Thumbs Up Right" border="0" /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1116107#msg1116107">Quote from: akryl9296 on March 01, 2015, 04:12:56 AM</a></div><div class="quote">It would self-regulate then, like in nature x)<br /></div>Doooooubt it hahahaha! If I have any experience with programmed systems it is that they always do the opposite, ie get stuck in a self-enforcing loop and fly out on a tangent. It could be possible to make it happen if you added a lot of dampers and clampers to basically force everything to be stable, but then you&#039;re not really running a simulation either way, so it&#039;d kind of defeat the purpose.<br /><br /><b>Update 403</b><br />Working on giving lizards individual traits. It&#039;s difficult, as the most important thing still is that the breeds are easy to tell apart.<br /><br />First thing I did was to set up a false bell curve distribution generator. I know that an actual bell curve is the <i>effect </i>of semi-random distribution, but here I&#039;m backwards engineering it - I created a system that made the distributions bell cruve-like. The formula can be skewed to have a varying tendency of distributing towards the edges or bring in the results towards the average:<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/JbdH9.gif" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />This is used mainly for random differences in color and size. <br /><br />The next step was to map the &quot;spine&quot;, or body mesh, of the lizard. This isn&#039;t so obvious as it might seem, as the lizard isn&#039;t one single mesh but actually consists of a body and a tail, and a head, and there are troublesome transition areas between all of these. After some fussing I got this result:<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/lG93r.gif" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />As you can see the system not only maps the points along the &quot;spine&quot;, but also the perpendicular vectors of each point and the &quot;depth-rotation&quot; effect from when the lizard moves around.<br /><br />When I got this spine mapping in order, the obvious first thing to do was a ridge of scales/bumps/spikes along the back of the lizard. Later I want to add more stuff, like maybe little tassels on the tips of their tails, or some feathery/scaly appendages sticking out of their shoulders, as well as different stuff that might be attached to the head rather than the body. At this point I have some individual variations looking like this:<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/vtk8X.gif" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />I&#039;m happy with where things are headed, and I&#039;m having a lot of fun, but as you can imagine this stuff can soak up an infinite amount of work, so I&#039;m going to have find some point where it&#039;s good enough for now. <br /><br />As you can see I&#039;ve already started working a little bit with the balance between individual traits and breed traits. For example the greens are more prone to have a comb of scaly things along their back - the pinks sometimes do, but it&#039;s generally smaller and less colorful. The greens tend to have the more &quot;feathery&quot; appendages, whereas pinks usually have the &quot;spiky&quot; ones, when they do at all. This here sample isn&#039;t the best to show it, but there are some differences in how fat/skinny they are, compare the two leftmost pinks on the second row. There are also differences in head size and tail length/width, but that stuff had to be downplayed quite a lot as it made many individuals look absolutely ridiculous. <br /><br />Here&#039;s a better example of skinny and fat specimens:<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/2eOPb.png" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />The fine balance to strike here is to make it so that individuals are recognizable while still keeping the breeds clearly separated. In this sample it&#039;s still visible (I hope) that the green is larger than the pink is larger than the blue, but the line is already becoming hazy - despite the individual differences not being super obvious! Apart from that there&#039;s the challenge of making all of them look <i>good</i>. In a sample of tens of individuals like this it&#039;s easy to be forgiving if one is not so hot, but if you have a minute-long encounter with a single lizard in a room and it looks goofy it&#039;s more problematic. So I&#039;m anticipating it&#039;s going to be a bit difficult. But a lot of fun, for sure&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/grin.gif" alt="Grin" border="0" /></div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/052.html#1028">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

New for today is the scaly things with some physics interaction.

I don&#039;t know if the reds will look radically different from the pinks, but in any case you might want hedge your bets and adjust the colour ranges of the pinks so that they don&#039;t hit red. Maybe head in the opposite direction on the colour spectrum and range between magenta/purple rather than magenta/red? That way you don&#039;t have quite so much of a problem distinguishing between the two, and red is pretty much exclusive to the really scary one.<br /><br />EDIT: <table style="background-color:#b090a040; border:1px solid #ffffff; padding:5px"><td><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/LOST IMAGE.png" width="150px" alt="" border="0"/></td></table><br /></div>Yeah, there is a lot of space between the purplest hues of the blues and the bluest hues of the pink, but the pinks are sometimes getting way too close to red. I&#039;ve placed them there on the color wheel because I like the warm purples more, they contrast better to the typically cold colors of the background. Another issue is that the human eye&#039;s experience of hue differences doesn&#039;t perfectly line up with the RGB (or rather HSL) model of the computer - some portions of the color wheel we divide into many separate color concepts, while there&#039;s a good fourth or so that we generalize to &quot;blue&quot;. I read some anthropology article somewhere that these divisions are actually heavily influenced by culture - western culture tends to see blue as separate from green, while many other cultures see these as variations of the same color, while being better at identifying the warmer greens. At the end of the day, I can&#039;t really do much more than going by my own eye. When the reds come around the pinks are definitely going to have to scoot over into the colder hues though, unless I come up with some smart workaround. Maybe the lizards could get a secondary color, similar to the vultures right now (vultures actually generate two hue-related colors, you might notice that the feathers are different than the shoulder pads) and create distinction that way.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1116705#msg1116705">Quote from: marcgfx on March 03, 2015, 06:04:23 AM</a></div><div class="quote">looks like you are having a lot of fun!

Backers generally have more insight in our development progress, and might be more well-meaning as they understand that it&#039;s a work in progress, and knows what is implemented yet and what is planned to come along, etc. Also I agree that Rain World is probably better experienced as a finished-ish product, I think we&#039;d want to at least have the all of the areas areas and the more important creatures finished before release. <br /><br />#pups, as for the name, nothing is concerning me less at the moment hahahaha &nbsp;<img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0" /> Remember that the names won&#039;t actually feature in the game, it&#039;s just for the devlog and other conversations about the game. A piece of trivia though, I believe the pups were &quot;pups&quot; before the slugcat was &quot;slugcat.&quot; When it comes to the actual gameplay element, yes sure we do still plan to include them! But as some of you have noted, the environments are quite hostile, so we might want to tone down the escort quests a bit. Perhaps the pups could be made more stationary, so that they generally hang out in a shelter and the challenge is more about bringing them food than about taking them from A to B. We&#039;ll have to see how it develops though.</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/052.html#1039">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

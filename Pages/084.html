Yeah, valid. Unfortunately... both things are true simultaneously. Content is wrapped up and we are doing final group testing with new players on controls and tutorial elements. The only thing left other than that is some polishing up of art / UI elements and assorted bug-fixes.<br /><br />As for the change in date, the past few months we&#039;ve been sprinting like crazy to hit a certain release window (that was *really* soon), but some 3rd party stuff came up last minute that couldnt be avoided and now we have to wait until the next window. Its not AS bad as you probably think, but we cant announce it until some other things get locked into place.<br /><br />For some context, at this point there are a bunch of other moving pieces beyond just when the game is finished. Publishers and porting teams and platforms all have packed release schedules the next few months, and for a successful launch everything has to line up just right for all of them. With all the time, money and blood (so much bloooood) thats been poured into this project, we have to nail these last steps.<br /><br />No question that we&#039;re disappointed though, because we absolutely killed ourselves to get things wrapped up in time (seriously, its been brutal), only to get derailed by elements that were out of our control. But honestly... this is best for the game too. In order to make the sooner timeline work out we were compromising on the quality of certain things in ways that neither of us were comfortable with. Now with this added time we can polish the polish and add that last 5%... and get that big content update ready to go for post-launch&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/hand-anykey.gif" alt="Hand Any Key" border="0" /><br /><br />So anyway, on to the twitter death threats! </div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/084#1666">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

Okay, back from E3. Whew that was intense&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/shocked.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /><br /><br />Yes, quite a few nice long gameplay vids up! That Sony underground one Christian linked was good, and we had a 30 min long twitch interview that wound up going pretty deep too. Others vids we&#039;re pretty short or catch me at various stages of exhaustion, so probably not interesting for all you Rain World experts here.<br /><br />So! To answer some of the above questions, for this E3 we were in the SONY booth and wound up at the last minute having to port a build to playstation 4 in an *extremely small* amount of time. Like, completely impossible actually. But somehow, shockingly, it all worked out! I can&#039;t get into specifics about it as its NDA and contract related stuff right now, but the first time I was able to even play the show build was *literally on the show floor* at the SONY booth the first morning of E3. Basically we were like &quot;I... hope this works&quot;, lol. Not. an. ideal. situation. believeeeeeeeee me.<br /><br />For that reason it was a pretty old (but stable!) build getting ported that just happened to be laying around exactly when we needed it, so there were tons of minor things with it. For instance that build was what we were using to test the observer&#039;s behavior, so as you noticed they were a little annoying. There were actually quite a few crashing bugs in this build too, so the challenge was to do these interviews showing large chunks of the gameplay while avoiding certain creature or world interactions that would bring up error screens while being livestreamed on the front page of twitch or whatever. SUPER HARD MODE! lmao. But doing events like this (and i have done many), you find that you just have to roll with whatever comes and make the best.<br /><br />Anyway! Back to the grind...<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/ClGhZYpVAAATD0g.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/084#1671">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

Del was swamped working on in-game content, so Adult Swim swooped in and hired Daniel, who did seriously amazing work in such a short period. Maximum pro effort and massively appreciated.<br /><br />im not sure of its fate though, as we&#039;ll likely want to keep Del&#039;s style at the forefront, so we&#039;ll see! but worst case scenario it makes for a very very nice placeholder!</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/084#1676">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

Still crunching, or have you guys had time for a breather with the release being pushed back?<br /></div><br />Hey Christian, thanks for checking in! We&#039;re in a sort of awkward crunch i guess? Past 2 weeks we&#039;ve been waiting for some large-scale testing results to come in and biding our time with finishing up the RW version of &quot;cutscenes and cinematics&quot;, but we just found out that the testing group that ASG was working with sort of flaked out apparently! So now we&#039;re regrouping for another set of tests next week that will be held at Adult Swim HQ in Atlanta and I&#039;ll be flying down to oversee to make sure we get some results.<br /><br />This is all testing the tutorial elements and early game stuff, seeing how players who are totally unfamiliar with the game approach problems: if they are understanding the game mechanics and how to progress, etc etc. (Long story short: no, they aren&#039;t) That seems to be the biggest problem we&#039;re having. Players are impressed with the visuals and atmosphere and are having fun, but without being explicitly told what to do they just get lost, die a lot and get frustrated after a while.<br /><br />It&#039;s *really* hard stuff for us to understand as developers, having played the game for 4 years and you know, designed every element or whatever, so we&#039;re hoping to iterate a few builds during this week of testing to try a few different concepts on fresh eyes. We&#039;ve been stubbornly refusing to use text cues in the game, but its getting to a ridiculous point where Joar has spent weeks on versions of very cool &quot;holographic&quot; dynamically occurring contextually-dependant tutorial animations and players STILL aren&#039;t understanding, where a simple &quot;press X to jump&quot; text box would solve everything. So... its probably time we acquiesce and just put in some dang text (at least for the tutorial!)<br /><br />While all this is going on Del has been finishing up cutscene illustrations, and Joar has been diligently working on wrapping up the ever-expanding list of bugs and events and polish. Right now he&#039;s expanding the interactions with Scavenger society quite a bit, as they are coming into more prominence during the mid-game. (I dont think its really spoiler stuff, so he could probably post about it. I&#039;ll ask him!)<br /><br /><br />One thing that we&#039;ve sort of been aware of for a while but now is very clear: we basically made the game that we wanted to make, but now have to make several other easier to understand games within that game, because our version of the game is too loose and indecipherable. This isn&#039;t a bad thing at all really, as it means that the finished version is going to be much closer to *actually playable* and so vastly more people will be able to have fun. And none of that takes away from &quot;our game&quot;, which is still 100% there and will exist for high skill players to discover. We&#039;ve created this huge world and there&#039;s plenty of room to fill it with stuff!<br /><br /></div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/084#1677">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

Not sure how feasible it would be, but could you make that a tutorial? A &quot;monkey see, monkey do&quot; kind of thing? Traveling with an older/slugcat partner going through a linear area, the other slugcat performing moves and such, thus demonstrating to the player what to do?<br /></div><br />Ideally, yes! This was my first suggestion waaaay back when we were starting the tutorial stuff, but apparently Rain World&#039;s character movement and AI are done in a manner thats completely opposite to &quot;sockpuppeting&quot;: the movement AI is completely tied to pathfinding and a million other systems, so we can&#039;t just plop in another slugcat and ask it to act without rebuilding a bunch of super low level systems. Very annoying, but also not atypical for &quot;Rain World problems.&quot; With our tools and engine it&#039;s easy to do weird Rain Worldy stuff, and hard to do normal basic gamey stuff.<br /><br />So! As you may have surmised from earlier posts, we&#039;re using a friendly Overseer, who we call &quot;Iggy&quot;, to fill in that role and show the player the ropes, and that aspect is working out really well.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1262911#msg1262911">Quote from: Teod on July 08, 2016, 11:25:20 PM</a></div><div class="quote">In my experience as a player the best alternative to text is animation of the button(s) being pressed. If you combine it with animated holograms you seem to already have, you&#039;ll end up with demonstration of input needed to perform an action, which is an equvalent of &quot;press X to jump&quot; thing. It will also be more useful than text for combinations of keys and for actions where timing is important, such as backflips: it&#039;s harder to understand &quot;move in one direction, then change the direction of your movement and jump&quot; in text than in visual form. Basically show <i>how</i> the hologram does what it does, not just what.<br /><br /></div><br />Yep, totally! Iggy projects context-appropriate gamepad and button-presses if the player isnt able to quickly progress through certain level puzzles, plus offers hints, etc. I think my &quot;press X to jump&quot; example was misleading, as that basic stuff is going relatively well, its more teaching the player to understand the relationships between the various game mechanics: hunting food, eating food, finding shelter, the map system, the rain cycle countdown, and of course... the weird and confusing &quot;karma system&quot; which will probably never make sense to anyone but us.<br /><br />Right now we have it so that Iggy takes the player through a cycle, shows them the controls, some slugcat moves, shows them some foods sources, shows them to a shelter, and players are totally fine completing that no problem. But without being told explicitly &quot;you need X food to survive&quot; and &quot;the rain is coming, which will kill you, so you need to find a shelter&quot; they don&#039;t really see how those puzzle pieces connect. <br /><br />So! I think we&#039;ll try adding just that and try how that goes, fingers crossed.

This has been an incredibly frustrating process and im so disappointed that it has taken this long, sorry. We shipped patch code for the PS4 version literally 2 days after the game launched, and basically its been back and forth between us, ASG, the people doing the PS4 port, and sony for the past month. <br /><br />There was a &quot;finished&quot; patch version that got through the process a week ago which was intended to go out, but somehow aspects of the sleep screen UI got messed up (<img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/huh.gif" alt="Huh?" border="0" />), stuff thats only apparent later in the game, and its just luck that I happened to triple check before it went out. <br /><br />So now thats being addressed. Hope is that it can be out early next week, but there has been so many bugaboos with this PS4 patch that i dont want to make any official announcements until its done, tested, and in my hands. <br /><br />Doubly frustrating because it takes time away from us working on the new content! Every time a new version of the patch comes in, its like 3 days solid of me and the ASG QA team running it for bugs.<br /><br />Anyway! Pardon the vent, but thats whats up with that.</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/092#1822">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

Previously I had loaded all the sounds of the game on startup (a clunky setup, but we had to do it that way so James could feed it external sound files) and that soaked up a loooot of RAM. So I decided to try to load the sounds through Unity instead ~ and that actually worked. So now the game is lazy-loading the sounds, and RAM is doing much better. But the REAL good news is that this enabled me to call the elusive Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets(); method, which just drops everything in RAM that&#039;s not being used. I couldn&#039;t do that before because Unity didn&#039;t recognize all of my hack-loaded sounds and ditched them, but now after a few tweaks it worked out, and *that* truly worked wonders for the RAM issue, it seems.

Touch wood, fingers crossed, but seems to actually be a big step in the right direction!<br /><br />In difficulty mode news, things are coming along.

Actual split screen would be the only Real Solution, and I&#039;ve been experimenting with that, but that in turn creates a bunch of difficulties with the shaders. So idk ~ we definitely want co-op, it seems like it could be really awesome, but it takes some serious thinking to come up with a good solution!

If any of you are speed runners I&#039;d really like your input on that - I can as easily leave it in as take it out, but need to know what speedrunners prefer! Here&#039;s two ways I imagine you could think about it.<br /><br />1) Take it out - it basically circumvents the entire game, and now that we&#039;ve seen it there&#039;s not much more to add. It would be more interesting from a speedrun perspective to take it out so you actually have to play more of the game, and the people who found this exploit will be forever remembered in the hall of fame.<br /><br />2) Leave it in - taking out exploits as they&#039;re discovered is cheap, speedrunning is all about finding those and if you find them the reward should be yours!<br /><br /><br /></div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/092#1827">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

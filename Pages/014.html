For example I re-wrote the code for how lizards behave in relation to eggs, so now it&#039;s more or less working again. I also moved one of the filters that&#039;s applied to the levels - earlier it was applied when saving the level, now it&#039;s applied when tha game loads it. It adds a few fractions of a second to the loading times, but it cuts the size of the level files in half.<br /><br />Other than that I&#039;ve been doing a little bit of level design, for the tutorial levels actually:<br /><br /><table style="background-color:#b090a040; border:1px solid #ffffff; padding:5px"><td><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/LOST IMAGE.png" width="150px" alt="" border="0"/></td></table><br /><br />There will be three of them, and they&#039;ll teach you how to run, crawl, jump and climb. When you&#039;re finished with them you&#039;ll enter the hub world, and won&#039;t be able to return.<br /><br />Apart from all this I&#039;ve started to modify the level editor in order to support a big change - a function that will render <i>all </i>the levels in one long go. The process will probably be several hours, but I hope that it&#039;ll be able to do it in the background while I use the computer for other stuff. What I&#039;ve gotten done so far is: 1, the level editor is now able to render a level without showing it on the screen, speeding up the process somewhat. 2, the level editor now saves and loads the light mask. Earlier you had to re-draw what parts of the level you wanted to be lit and what parts should be in shadow every time you wanted to render it. Being able to render a large number of levels with the press of one button will make the creation and modification of bigger chunks of the hub world much more effective.<br /><br />Edit: The mass renderer is up and running! I can select an entire list of levels and it works its way through them. I figure it&#039;s torture to the processor and RAM, but it&#039;s possible to do other stuff (such as writing this) while it&#039;s rendering. It&#039;s always an awesome feeling when you get a powerful dev tool working.<br /><br />Edit edit: Aaaaand there&#039;s a bug. -.- Gotta track it down.</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/014.html#260">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

Got it to work <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/tongue.gif" alt="Tongue" border="0" /><br /><br />Another interesting thing that happened yesterday was that an extension I used <i>suddenly </i>became aware that it&#039;s actually a trial version, out of nowhere. And for the trial version I&#039;m only allowed to use two functions, so I was robbed of the cryptation function I&#039;d been using for the save games.<br /><br />However, I used my brain and decided that I was perfectly able to understand how basic string cryptation works, and wrote the functions myself. Basically, I convert each character to its ASCII number, and add to that number the corresponding character in the key string. The decryptation works the same way, but with subtraction. <br /><br />I&#039;m pretty sure there&#039;s a way to decrypt this, especially if the key is short enough to see it repeat, but honestly, if you&#039;re gonna go through that trouble you&#039;re welcome to mess with your save file. The only thing I want is for it not to be <i>too </i>tempting to just open up the save and give yourself 10 000 spears.</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/014.html#261">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

The very basics of it is very... basic. You only need two functions: one to determine the distance between two points and one to give the direction as a vector from one point to another. With that you can emulate &quot;chains&quot;, i.e. points moving about freely but being stuck to other points at certain distances.<br /><br />So in my game, the player consists of two such points (upper/lower body) and the lizard consists of 3. Then I attatch to that additional points for limbs and so on. For example the tails of the creatures are several such points chained together. <br /><br />On top of this stuff I draw the creatures, using simple sprite mechanics such as rotation. For example, the arm of a creature is drawn at the shoulder and then rotated towards the location of the hand point. <br /><br />This is the reason why the creatures are one, solid color. In fact they consist of several sprites overlapping each other in awkward ways, and if there was any kind of shading on the sprites this would be visible. If I worked in a more reasonable software I could compile the whole body of the creature to one picture and then shade it, but I&#039;m not, so the flat colors are staying. Instead I&#039;ve tried to adapt my style so that it&#039;ll look ok.<br /><br />When it comes to the more specific movement of limbs and so on it&#039;s a great deal of faking going on. The lizards for example do <i>not </i>grab on to stuff and pull themselves forward. Instead they move about with a magical force pushing them in whatever direction they are going. When a limb is too far behind the body it goes into a &quot;search mode&quot;, looking for possible grasps in front of the lizard. Such a thing might be a wall, a pole, a platform or whatever. When it finds one, the limb connects to it, and then passively stays there until it&#039;s left behind by the body again. The magical propulsion force of the body is dependent on how many limbs are currently connected to terrain, making the speed of movement uneven and synced to the movement of the limbs (few limbs grasping - slow movement of the body).<br /><br />If there is demand, I could make a more in-depth technical tutorial.</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/014.html#264">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

Kinda sorta IK implementation. One question that pops to mind though, if you have a propulsion force that is based on the number of limbs down, but that is unpredictable, are all of the character speeds in the game unpredictable? Or is there some other driving force at a higher level? Also, are these the same systems that drive the player characters in the game?<br /></div>I&#039;ll write one up for you! <br />The variable movement speed is only for the lizards, the player has a constant speed and the movement of the limbs is purely cosmetic. For the lizards though, the answer is yes, the speed is unpredictable. However they do have a weak propulsion force even when no limbs are connecting at all, to not get stuck.</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/014.html#265">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

Because I don&#039;t seem to be able to create the design, I thought I&#039;d skip ahead to the raw functionality, and that has been working better. Here&#039;s the &quot;den screen&quot;, i.e. the screen you look at between levels:<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/9gysk6.jpg" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />What&#039;s going on here is this - <br />Up left is the calendar, showing all the days you need to survive. The marked days are the days when there&#039;s a paus in the rain, hunting days. The player is just coming in from his fifth hunt. Down in the corner is the pile of bugs. As you can see, the pile starts at seven, that&#039;s the excess from the fourth hunt.<br /><br />The player has caught 9 flies, these are added to the pile. Then the calendar starts to move, and 7 days pass. Each day one fly is removed from the pile (eaten or digested or whatever). Finally we arrive at the sixth hunt, with 9 flies still in the stock pile.<br /><br />As you can see, this means that there&#039;s no need to go out hunting the sixth hunt, because there are only seven days until the next opportunity. This is true, and the game allows you to just go straight back in the den if you want to. I think I like the ability to hoard flies like that, it creates more freedom for the player to play with their own style. When you reach the very end of the campaign, your flies stockpile will be your high score.</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/014.html#266">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

While I could compile a Mac version (which I think would lag, because that&#039;s my experience with Director executables for mac) I wouldn&#039;t have the add-ons, so the game wouldn&#039;t be able to do a lot of important stuff.

That&#039;s good news. It&#039;s lagging horribly on my notebook though, but as long as it&#039;s running at all I&#039;m decently happy. Would&#039;ve been a shame if the thing was already outdated at release. Game pad works too, but needs some tweaking.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg916166#msg916166">Quote from: Zaphos on July 12, 2013, 02:05:12 PM</a></div><div class="quote">Are you planning to release it in some form anyway?&nbsp; I hope so ...<br /></div>Yes, I do plan to release it. It will be free to download and share, possibly with a paypal account where you can donate something small if you&#039;re in that kind of mood.<br /><br />As a lot of people seem to be interested in the technical aspect of the game, I&#039;ll try to find time to write something up on that. The basic idea is very simple though: While a game character normally consists of one box that can collide with terrain, the RW character consists of <i>two </i>boxes. So, instead of having a character that&#039;s always head up feet down, we have a character that consists of an upper body and a lower body, and they are moving around independently but at a fixed distance.</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/014.html#272">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

This is definitely the last game I make in director, and with that perhaps the last game that ever gets made in director...<br /><br /><b>Update 151</b><br />Sorted out a lot of smaller errors. Added the possibility to have different &quot;control modes&quot; for when you play with game pads - for example the possibility that it doesn&#039;t register vertical input as long as there is horizontal input, so that you have to push up or down very deliberately in order to have the character react. As it was there was some trouble that the character would suddenly get into crawling position when you&#039;re running, because you happen to nudge downwards. This isn&#039;t a problem with keyboard controls, obviously - if you press a button you know that you&#039;re pressing that button.<br /><br />Game pad users can now map a pause button, which takes them to the menu from the game. This means that if player 1 is on a controller, the entire game including menues will be playable from the controller, so that there won&#039;t be any need to touch the keyboard or the mouse.<br /><br />Did a little work on the world map.<br /><br />Also, the game has for the first time been played with three players.

It doesn&#039;t sound much, but the game is getting complex, so there&#039;s a ton of things to think about when doing something like this, that &quot;breaks&quot; the game&#039;s original mechanics. A lot of things need to be handled, such as spears stuck in the lizard&#039;s body when it dissapears and so on. <br /><br />After dying the lizard lingers for a bit, before starting to produce smoke. After a while there&#039;s enough smoke (hopefully) to cover the lizard&#039;s body, at which point it can dissapear without it looking too ugly. I&#039;m not too concerned about the way it looks, as lizards dissapearing isn&#039;t canon to the game world, it&#039;s just a fun feature for multiplayer. <br /><br />Fateful to my tradition of ugly hacks the lizard will teleport to the bottom of the map, where the falling damage code will kick in, so I only have to write the respawn stuff once. The alternative would be setting up some kind of function that I&#039;d call from both the death-by-damage scenario and from the falling-out-of-the-map scenario, but as no-one but me will ever see the code this horrible solution seemed more convinient&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/tongue.gif" alt="Tongue" border="0" /><br /><br />I also added another setting for multiplayer, which disallows players from hiding in their holes; they&#039;re spat right out again. And I added a counter that keeps track of how long players have been alive during a match. Good for settling draws. These features will be fun for a new game mode I&#039;ve been contemplating - Survival. Survival won&#039;t be about catching flies, but will pit the players against each other and respawning lizards, without allowing them to hide in their holes, and the player that stays alive the longest wins. </div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/014.html#276">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

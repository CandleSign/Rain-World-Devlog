Anyways, this allows you to wait in a side tunnel for a lizard to crawl by, and then crawl out behind it and get away.<br /><br />You see the little bulge of vision covering the tail? If the point that&#039;s tested is close enough the angle is not tested, to simulate some kind of spatial sense and so that the player can&#039;t crawl into its tail without being noticed. <br /><br />In an open level like this a lizard in the right position can cover huge areas, and two of them can see pretty much the whole level. <br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/1zz2bua.jpg" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />I think this works well, because open areas are not the crocs&#039; favourite environment to move in. This creates a balance - close quarters: they won&#039;t spot you, but if they do you&#039;re done for. Open spaces: they&#039;ll spot you, but you have a fair chance of getting away.</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/002#20">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

To keep things simple and clear to the player the only thing that can cause a for the lizard hearable sound is landing on a floor after being airborne. If you make the tiniest possible jump by just tapping the button you&#039;ll make no sound at all. The variable of lizard hearing is how big the radius is within which it&#039;ll register this sound. <br /><br />It doesn&#039;t <i>know </i>where you are, as when seeing you, and it doesn&#039;t know which player it heard. All the sound does is that if a croc is idling or snooping around and hears a sound it&#039;ll go to the place the sound came from to check it out. When chasing a known target it&#039;ll ignore sounds. <br /><br />It is communicated to the player that a croc heard something in the way that it stops in its tracks for a second, as if listening. Once it eventually gets a head it will probably turn this towards the source of the sound as well. <br /><br /></div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/002#21">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

Not eat, that&#039;s a matter of animation and will be attended to later, but magically kill on touch. The croc is now able to lash out to a close by player, making it impossible to jump over it on a floor. <br /><br />As I mentioned the croc is already slower than you out on open floors, and that together with you being able to jump and it only being able to turn made it possible to jump over its head again and again for ever. The new mechanic means that you can&#039;t do that any more. You can still jump over it by using a wall though.<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/1255dza.jpg" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />Almost all the mechanics I imagined for the game are in now, but there&#039;s a lot of number tweaking to do. However, I feel that I&#039;m finally at the end of the huge chunk of this project that has been the croc AI, and hopefully no other part will take as much time. There will be a revisiting to this though, when I have a little less schoolwork to do so I can try the game out with a friend. I have no idea how the crocs handle multiple players, it could be just fine, it could be in need of some redesign. <br /><br />It&#039;s too hard to cath the A-creatures, need to tweak that a bit. Another thing I was thinking of was that maybe the player shouldn&#039;t eat the creatures on touch, but rather just catch them, and then you have to go find a safe place to consume your prey. I like this idea, will have to see how it plays out in reality. <br /><br />Been thinking a lot lately about how I will render levels. Have some kind of semi-voxel idea going on, more on that later. However, with level rendering comes art, and with art the devlog becomes interesting! Hopefully the daily five page essays on how a virtual lizard finds its way around a maze has finally come to an end...

That&#039;s when the path is being calculated. I don&#039;t want it to be standing still during this process, because its speed will be a que to what behaviour it&#039;s engaged in. I prefer that it runs back an forth as in a bit of initial confusion, then suddenly realizes what path it&#039;ll take.

The system is now working in a semi-voxel kind of way, where one tile is 20*20*10 pixels. I also made the level editor able to save a level in the format that I think will be final. Didn&#039;t try loading yet though... The level seems to be very light, so I&#039;m happy about that.<br /><br />The voxel format allows me to do some interesting stuff such as fog and light...<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/21bvq4w.jpg" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />This is just 20 minutes of coding to test it, but I like the potential it has. Because of the voxels I don&#039;t have to create separate solutions for everything, stuff sorts itself out automatically. If you look at the detail in the lower right corner maybe you can imagine what a hassle it would be to calculate how the shadows would look in every special case like this, now it just works by itself.<br /><br />It&#039;s flawed, yes, I have noticed the stripy floors. Also it will demand some patience, rendering it pixel by pixel will take a minute or two for an entire level. But I see a lot of potential in it!<br /><br /></div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/002#24">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

The level editor will work like this:<br /><br />First, there will be the level editor. Here, two players can work at the same level simultaneously and create the layout of the level. You&#039;ll be able to save the level in som kind of test version, with no real graphics, just to try it out and make adjustments. Once you&#039;re happy with the geometrics you move on to the graphics phase.<br /><br />In the tile editor, you can place objects that correspond to the level you&#039;ve already made. Here I think it&#039;s going to switch to mouse control, it would be too tedious otherwise. So you look at your level and place tiles, but you&#039;re only editing the appearance of the level, it will still function exactly like it did when you tested it. Right now you can decide if a tile will be smooth concrete or rough rock, but there&#039;ll be much more to that as I start to produce some actual graphics.<br /><br />Then there&#039;s the effects editor. Here you add plants and the like, it&#039;ll make sense to you when you see it (or I describe it in more detail later). Essentially it&#039;ll be stuff that grows on/hangs from/is applied to the tiles you&#039;ve placed earlier.<br /><br />After the effects are applied you&#039;ll move on to the exciting procedure of staring at light being raytraced for two minutes.<br /><br />Finally the level is rendered and can be saved.<br /><br />With the art editor I&#039;m struggling with a balance, on one hand I want the editor to be free enough to make the level look like you want it, on the other hand I want it to be somewhat constrained. This is because not all people are artists, and you should be able to make a level that looks better than you would&#039;ve been able to draw free-hand. Also I don&#039;t want you to be able to make a level that strays too far from the game&#039;s general art direction. We&#039;ll see where on this scale of freedom/constraint it finally ends up.</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/002#32">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

The stuff that&#039;s happening is mainly level editor stuff though, and I don&#039;t really have anything to show you. Personally I find user interfaces the most hard/boring thing to do, and it&#039;s a lot of that going on in the level editor. The user interface is going to suck, but I don&#039;t mind too much as I don&#039;t really think of the level editor as an official part of the game. <br /><br />It&#039;s also important to me that the level editor I release is the same as the one <i>I</i> use to make the built-in levels, I don&#039;t like the dummed down level editors that are included in some games where it&#039;s obvious that the developers had access too a much wider variety of tools. So, in conclusion, the level editor is becoming ugly and hard to use, but it&#039;s more of a development tool that I&#039;ll also let you guys play with than an actual part of the game. I might include some kind of little tutorial on how to use it, though.<br /><br />In other level editor news the tile editor is up and running, even more so than before. It works, it displays little previews, it&#039;s fairly fast and easy to use and it doesn&#039;t have any tile sets to work with yet. Still, the boring technical parts are more or less done by now. <br /><br />Damn, it seems the level editor is the new croc path finding... Well, if I&#039;m ever going to arrive to the point where this dev log is going to flood with juicy images there needs to be a level editor to generate those images, so it&#039;s all good I guess.<br /><br />Over and out!</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/002#33">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

With the wasd-keys you can change tool and with the mouse you place tiles. All tiles are loaded from a folder on initiation, they require much less space as external files. The little dark square to the right is the tile&#039;s requirements. It shows what kind of terrain a tile can be placed on. Some tiles can only be placed on slopes, some require open air in the middle and so on. This is what I meant earlier, that you first create your level and then you&#039;re only able to change its appearance.<br /><br />After you&#039;ve edited your tile layout you&#039;ll move on to the effects editor, which I haven&#039;t started on yet. After that you&#039;ll move on to a light editor, which I haven&#039;t started on either, but that one is going to be fairly simple. Basically it&#039;s going to be about drawing a black and white image which determines where there will be light and where there won&#039;t. Then the light will be rendered.<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/34f04jr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />During this process you can go get a cup of coffee...<br /><br />Finally the level will be rendered in its final colors. Currently this looks like this, but I don&#039;t plan to keep it that way. This is still just technical progress, I&#039;ve started thinking about the art but haven&#039;t gotten around to it.<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/15efndi.jpg" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />Tiles come in two versions, &quot;box&quot; version and &quot;voxel&quot; version. The boxes are basically six textures, for the front and the sides of the tile. Those occupy less space on the hard drive and are faster to render, but are limited in what they can do. The &quot;voxel&quot; type are actual voxel structures, more or less, and can describe more complex three dimensional shapes. The fans or whatever in the above image are voxel structures. If you look at the close up you can see that they have another set of grates inside them. I needed the voxel format to be able to do complex three dimensional stuff like that.<br /><br />Now this framework is set up, and it&#039;s possible for me to start working on the graphics!<br /><br />On a completely different note I&#039;ve been thinking about how the Croc will look visually.

Still don&#039;t have anything I want to show you, but I&#039;m getting there. It&#039;s a lot of fun to work with the voxels, any three dimensional shape I can imagine I can create, and see with (decently) correct shadows. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been working on a system for palettes. Basically the goal is to convey both light and distance using as few colors as possible, which is not as easy as you might think, especially if you want to make the depth of the graphics justice. <br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/fwk4zr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />The reason I want to have few, flat colors is because a level will be pasted together from hundreds of graphical elements. By greatly restricting the palettte like this I achieve three things: <br />1) Some visual harmony, with many many colors it would hurt your eyes<br />2) Color will mainly be conveying level information, decoration is its second purpose. For the sake of conveiance three colors is actually enough (Look at the level editor), so ending up at 15 colors would be hard to motivate<br />3) Maybe most importantly, flat patches of color blend together. If everything has its own color every splice between graphical elements would be visible. If there are fewer colors, however, there&#039;s a much greater chance that two neighbouring fields will have the same color, making the joints invisible.<br /><br />Right now I&#039;m at 8 colors, a number I&#039;d like to reduce to 5. </div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/002#35">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

The way the game will be colored will be somewhat unconventional, but worry not, I do have a plan! Once I&#039;ve been able to produce a screenshot, or at least a mock-up, I&#039;ll do the concept / art style reveal and things will start to make more sense. Or they probably won&#039;t, but there will at least be some cohesion to the insanity!</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/002#36">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

It&#039;s fun to see the lizards spot you through a glass wall and then find a way to get to the other side of the glass. Don&#039;t know how much I will actually use this in the levels, but it&#039;ll be in there somewhere just to point out the divide between visual contact and path finding, showing off some croc intelligence. Possibly there&#039;ll be some level that&#039;s a maze of glass with only a few blocks of solid material, where you&#039;ll have to move quickly from cover to cover waiting for a croc to face the other direction. </div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/002#37">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

This is for artistic reasons that I hope will be more clear once I get more visual stuff up here. Talking of which, I did some pen and paper designs for the croc today! Also started to implement it a little bit, it now looks like a little sasuage moving around rather than three dots. A first few steps towards giving it an actual body!<br /><br /><b>Update 28</b><br />I stepped away from my computer a little and did some sketches for the earliest single player levels in the game. I think this is a reasonable way to start, because if I know what levels I want to make I can make art assets that fit those, rather than making a lot of random art assets and then trying to fit those into the levels.<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/2sbl7d2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />Those are likely going to be the very first levels, but they are also likely to look different from this. These levels will teach the players the controls and the basic premiss of the game. I&#039;m trying to do this as best as I can, keeping <br /><iframe width="640" height="385" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8FpigqfcvlM?fs=1&start=" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /> in mind. I won&#039;t go into too much detail, but level 1 basically teaches you how your basic moves work, and level 2 teaches you the basic mechanics of A-creature/B-creature interaction.<br /><br />The main thing that happened today, aside from all this, was that I split the level editor and the game into two different applications. It got too cluttered, and I also figured that this way I might be able to release the two separately. That way people who&#039;re not interested in making levels get a smaller file size, and I can also release them at different dates, meaning I don&#039;t have to polish the level editor to perfection just to release the game.</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/002#38">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

This is mainly a question of lazyness, as now I won&#039;t have to make separate animations for a creature entering its hole and a creature entering a short cut. Basically the spawn points/home holes are shortcut openings, but instead of leading to another shortcut opening they lead to an invisible little flag, saying &quot;this is a bear spawnpoint&quot; or &quot;this is a croc hole&quot;. <br /><br />The croc is becoming more and more animated, now it has a body and a tail. Legs next, or head. </div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/002#39">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div><br></body>

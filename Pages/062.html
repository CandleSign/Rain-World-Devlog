So sorry if thats a nuisance for anyone!<br /><br />that build was done for pax east, so is around 3 months old. i did a playtesting event with it last night (since its still the most stable), and man is it weird to demo old builds! all i wanted to do was show off the buggy new stuff, but alas its not ready for public consumption yet. E3 build is going to be quite a quantum leap of advancement. Joar is on a dev rampage!<br /><br />Oh and just to spice things up a *tiny bit* from our boring text posts, Joar did a bunch of new procedural plants recently to give the region flora some diversity.

When you make the comparisons like that I actually get a bit of cold feet. I really do want some dirt and stuff though, and the graffiti was an important world building aspect to me. I wanted to use it to set a tone and to tell little bits about the world, perhaps. Your input makes me realize that I have to think about it more though, I can&#039;t just slap it on top or I risk ruining what I already have.<br /><br />Maybe placement could play a part? Maybe it&#039;s preferable for decals (be it dirt or graffiti or rust or other) to be confined to some sort of definable geometrical object rather than existing everywhere as an ambient?<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/2ZjSU.png" alt="" border="0" /></div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/062#1226">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

I think everybody would agree this looks awesome:<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/Ye21K3B.gif" alt="" border="0" /> <br /><br />the obvious solution from my perspective is to work in some new rooms that take into consideration the graffiti visual element so we can nail that look, and then add a bunch of smaller graf element details to surrounding rooms to tie it all together. The suburban region specifically has a lot of re-working to be done, and even an entire sub-region to add, so this is all part of the visual polish plan really! And this doesnt mean &quot;here is a randomly convenient wall for graffiti&quot;, but more just some rooms that aren&#039;t already so visually saturated so we can get the look for the graf elements nice and tight without 30 layers of clutter getting in the way. <br /><br /><br />We both agree that this is something worth spending some time to fuss with and get right, so considering the rush were in to get an E3 build put together, were thinking that now is probably not the right time to dive too deep into all that. so...

One of the big technical hold backs we&#039;re constantly fighting with!<br /><br />@Jimym GIMBERT, whatever built this place had two distinct alphabets, as you can see in the neon signs. The graffiti generally uses stylized versions of the same alphabets. I&#039;m going to include some typographic graffiti because I like the look of it, but there&#039;ll also be some graffiti that is more &quot;out there&quot;, such as the big spleen or whatever in that picture James posted. I want to explore that direction more, to create that sense of &quot;why the hell would someone draw this!?&quot; in order to further make you empathize with the slugcat&#039;s semi-animal nature; it can understand that the signs and images convey some sort of meaning, but can only have a very dim and confused grasp of what that meaning would be.</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/062#1228">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

I think James&#039; enthusiasm would be curbed&nbsp; by the outlook of having to re-render every room with a neon sign in it (which amounts to... every room) &gt;__&lt;<br /><br />I already have two fictional alphabets going, and I absolutely won&#039;t introduce a third without cutting one or both of the old ones out. They <i>were</i> however made sort of quickly, a long time ago, for a game I imagined would be a month long side project... So maybe it is actually time to switch them up. It wouldn&#039;t need to be too harrowing, as I could just replace the neon sign assets but have the same names for them, and then they&#039;ll be naturally replaced as the rooms are re-rendered for touchups without us really having to do anything manually. That assumes that we&#039;ll re-render every room at least once more, which I think is probably the case. Otherwise there&#039;s a mass render function in the editor. So, it&#039;d be annoying, but it&#039;s not entirely out.<br /><br />Here are the current two alphabets:<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/jymTL.png" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />And here&#039;s a piece of graffiti with the letters clarified:<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/wtjvL.png" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />One thing I could do to get a tribal/mayan vibe going without replacing the alphabets, is to work more with the pictographical &quot;proto-comic&quot; sort of layout many ancient cultures seem to have employed. Like, images that are in some sort of chronological sequence with small bits of text flowing in and out of it. That could be really interesting to mix up with a graffiti aesthetic! </div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/062#1230">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

Deep dwellers that are shy of light are obviously not going to be big fans, and also I think it could be fun if ordinary creatures such as lizards could be rendered blind temporarily or permanently. </div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/062#1238">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

The resolution will be a problem so I&#039;ll probably have to go pretty big. We have a region planned with some more tribal stuff, where I think some big columns etc would fit right in.<br /><br />@Teod, I think of it as a chemical fire/light emission, similar to when you put flame to magnesium or something. But again, cartoon world&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /><br /><br />@tortoiseandcrow, when I implement enemy hearing I will also give their vision some tuning and combine those into a little Stealth Push. Right now vision is entirely binary - for a creature with a limited cone of vision it does that dot product check, some creatures have a distance cap, and then it checks if there&#039;s terrain in the way - but all of these are either YES or NO and it needs all YES&#039;s to get a visual. My idea for what I want to happen in the future is that a bunch of conditions will be considered as floats and combined. Such conditions could be camouflage, muddy water, and darkness. The factors should be able to interact (by multiplication or subtraction) so that you could stay hidden more easily if you&#039;re smart about it. <br /></div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/062#1239">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div><br></body>

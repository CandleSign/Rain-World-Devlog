As you move through the world it draws to a texture, which is then used to determine what of the map to reveal. <br /><br /><a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/sX7Pf.png" target="_blank"><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/sX7Pf.png" alt="" width="600" height="300" border="0" /></a><br /><br />The &quot;slow reveal&quot; animation looks like this (on a fully explored map, it looks slightly different if you just have bits and pieces uncovered):<br /><br /><table class="lostimage"><td><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/LOST IMAGE.png" width="150px" alt="" border="0"/></td></table><br /><br />It&#039;s essentially a flood-fill out from the player&#039;s position. We implemented this for a few reasons. <br /><br />One is that we want it to feel like you&#039;re accessing the slugcat&#039;s spatial memory rather than just bringing up a map on some HUD - the slugcat is an animal, not a cyborg super soldier. If it takes a bit of time, its communicated to the player that this is an act of thinking long and hard about what was where, not just &quot;bringing up the map&quot;. <br /><br />Another is that that the animation doubles as a time penalty. The idea is that the filling in animation should be somewhat satisfying and fun to watch, masking the penalty aspect from the player while the actual gameplay implications of it remain; namely that you spend precious seconds just standing still. Hopefully this will incentivize fewer and longer map sessions rather than quickly tabbing in and out of it once every room. We want the player to look at the game, not the HUD - if you flicker in and out of the map you don&#039;t pay as much attention to landmarks in the environment, and looking at the environment is exactly what we want you to do as much as possible. Also we want the player to have to keep at least <i>some </i>of their route in their head, as that&#039;s part of the game&#039;s challenge.<br /><br />A third one would be that your inability to move in combination with the enemy still being mobile will require you to find a good hiding spot for bringing the map up, which feels like a nice atmospheric element.<br /><br />The flood fill has a bit of a bias towards where you&#039;re panning the map, so you can sort of &quot;pull&quot; it a bit in one direction or another. If you release the map button quickly, your map reveal progress is saved, but if you wait for too long or move around too much it&#039;s reset. There is some forgiveness though, if you take the map down and quickly move a few steps in some direction you can bring it up again without it being reset. <br /><br />The blue color in the map signifies an edge of the explored area which is not a wall - basically somewhere you might potentially explore further. Not 100% settled on the aesthetic of that element just yet, but I think the functionality is sound, it makes a lot of sense that you should be able to easily browse for potential exploration destinations. <br /><br />The dotted lines are, as I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve understood, longer connections between rooms.<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/BrokenValidJumpingbean.gif" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />These have been a bit of a problem in some of the earlier regions, that were developed when we thought of the rooms more as free entities rather than part of a whole that should make geographical sense. HI (pictured) is sort of on the edge of that paradigm shift. In the gif you can see that I first pan over a bunch of rooms that make a lot of geographical sense, but then I pan to the right and things get pretty jumbled with lots of dotted lines crossing over each other and the rooms they&#039;re connected to. That latter chaotic look is part of what we&#039;re going to try to tone down in the upcoming level work. A big majority of it seems to be solvable just by re-connecting the rooms, and where that doesn&#039;t work we&#039;ll add the occasional simple little connector room. Not all of the dotted lines will necessarily be eliminated though - personally I kind of like having a few of them spicing up the look of the map. The criss-crossy chaos in the rightmost part of this map however will be worked with a bit.</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/074#1461">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

In the context of the game, you will yourself &quot;draw&quot; the map by moving through the region over and over again, so at any given time you should not be presented with more information than you can handle. <br /><br />For comparison, when you first enter a region the map won&#039;t look any more impressive/confusing than this:<br /><br /><a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/Y08ob.png" target="_blank"><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/Y08ob.png" alt="" width="800" height="400" border="0" /></a><br /><br />Which should definitely be within what anyone can deal with. From there you build the insane crazy big map yourself by moving around, meaning that you have an actual relationship to all the places shown in the map as you&#039;re guaranteed to have seen them in the actual game before.<br /><br />Reducing the map to an abstract node graph crossed my mind, but it has a pretty big downside - if the rooms are not at least to some degree depicted, how do you know which room is which?</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/074#1462">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

We havent even started putting the maps together in a clear manner, so these are intended to show the functionality of the map code (which is AWESOME) rather than examples of the finished product. Further, the map tools allow us to orient the room positions any way we wish, with up to 3 layers of depth if necessary, so im pretty confident that we can find clear solutions. <br /><br />its true that any map with be complex though. the world isnt aligned on a 2d plane (and *cant* be), so if a map is to be usable at all, it will have to have depth and 3dimensionality. <br /><br />Imagine the Fez map: <br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/fez-screen-cap1.png" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />but literally 10x times larger and more complex. AND we need a much higher visual fidelity if we want the map to serve any utility at all.

Maybe I kind of rushed ahead in posting those gifs of the fully revealed map of a fully un-polished region - looking at it again with your eyes it does look very confusing&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/whome.gif" alt="Who, Me?" border="0" /> These gifs were to show off a technical implementation, not the content of the map, which will make a big difference. A few notes that may address some of your concerns:<br /><br />The map will be mostly on a 2D plane - as many of the rooms as possible will be fitted next to each other. The multiple layers will be for some edge cases and the occasional secret passage branching off from a main 2D map. Hopefully this will feel exciting rather than confusing, imagine finding a passage that leads to a little secret area that is &quot;off the map&quot; so to speak.<br /><br />The movement of the map in that very short gif is really hard to follow. When you are in control of it yourself it comes across as way less hysterical - especially the layer switching is a looooot easier to understand when you have pushed a button yourself to make it happen.<br /><br />Once we have the rooms placed in a sensible manner, the map textures will get a manual touch-up to make them appear more like a cohesive whole rather than a bunch of disconnected little blocks. <br /><br />The fog of war really helps to make it understandable. I was showing the map to my dad, and initially he had the same impression as you guys - that it was an overwhelming information overload. Then I tried to turn the fog of war on and move through a few rooms, after which I brought the map up again. He was able to make sense of it because he had seen all the areas I had been running through and could recognize them on the map. This made him change his opinion about it quite a lot!<br /><br />As for the complexity, many of the regions are insanely complex! Talking about complexity here, not geographical disconnectedness - the former we want to keep, the latter we want to work with. We&#039;re fans of the complexity and size, it drives home an emotional point about the relentlessness of Rain World and the smallness of the slugcat. The vast size and sprawling nature of the regions is something we think of as a core aspect of the atmosphere of the game. We&#039;d like the map to reflect and visualize that aspect. Which, of course, shouldn&#039;t get in the way of actual playability, so if it does we will definitely take measures to make it easier. <br /><br />End of the day, I think it&#039;s pretty hard for any of the parties involved here to judge. James made the rooms, I made the map, and you guys have a 4 second gif of an unfinished chaotic region to look at which you can&#039;t control yourself but which just pans around frantically (my bad!). When we have a player going in fresh in a finished region with fog of war on and uncover it themselves, that would be a better measure of its utility. Depending on the outcome of that scenario we&#039;ll make the necessary edits to have the map be both an artful representation of the world and a useful tool for playing the game. <br /><br />As for now, I have to move on to some creature implementation, as map progress can&#039;t really proceed much further until we have some polished regions. But don&#039;t worry guys, we will make the map cool and useful&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0" /> Not gonna let you down!</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/074#1464">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

Mostly I&#039;d like to solve it by having the layer switching not be much of a concern - most of the map should be in layer 1, and when you do go to layer 0 or 2 there should ideally be a chunk of region in that same layer so in most cases you have the relevant information in the same layer displayed by default as you bring the map up. You will of course be able to switch between the layers, but there shouldn&#039;t be a significant amount of browsing between the z-layers.

This one is the &quot;scavenger&quot;, an intelligent creature that will play a part in the narrative that we won&#039;t spoil - however I&#039;ll share the development of the animation with your guys. <br /><br />Here are some sketches. We&#039;re aiming for something along the lines of the central one standing next to the slugcat.<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/rkul5.jpg" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />Here&#039;s what we have so far:<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/qLEZV.gif" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />This one is a knuckle walker, a type of locomotion I haven&#039;t done before so that should be interesting. Another challenge is that this creature is native to the Garbage Waste region (though it will appear in other places as well) which has some difficult terrain. Generally it&#039;s easiest for the creatures to move on flat floors, where they can build momentum in an easy linear direction that is aligned to the tile matrix. Garbage wastes however is mostly slopes, which is a bit harder to work with.<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/6PWlU.png" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />I&#039;m tackling this one by fetching a few stretch of a few tiles from the path finder rather than just the next tile to go to, and then I try to smoothen that a little bit.<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/vTSzx.gif" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />Still not completely effortless, but better than if it went tile by tile on the ground!

Looking pretty funny at this point though, some polish will be needed after the skin is applied. <br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/OpulentVibrantLark.gif" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />Also the lower body is supposed to have two little legs - a part&nbsp; haven&#039;t entirely figured out yet.<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/MinorDecisiveAmericancrow.gif" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />I think that for this creature the behavior and the look are so intimately connected that I will have to develop them side by side. We have a very specific idea about what the character of the creature should be, which is kind of a new situation. Generally so far we have had a vague concept and then the creature has grown out of that, concept being shaped by the technical implementation as much as the other way around. This one we have a few key words for though, such as &quot;intelligent&quot;, &quot;mysterious&quot;, &quot;intimidating&quot; and &quot;similar to you&quot;. Striking all of those is going to take some pretty fine tuning - as you can see I certainly haven&#039;t hit any yet&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/tongue.gif" alt="Tongue" border="0" /></div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/074#1471">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

Should be able to step it up again from now!<br /><br /><b>Update 499.75</b><br /><br />Further scavenger individualization. <br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/GracefulGranularDromedary.gif" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />The faces are already fairly individual, and the body types have some stuff going on (fatness, muscularity of arms) but could definitely go with more. More importantly though I want to attach some scales and tufts to them - that stuff is usually what gives the best effort/return ratio. My experience with the other creatures is that varying the thickness of some limb between 10% and 190% is generally barely noticeable, but just sticking some random stuff on that sticks out and breaks up the silhouette has a huge impact immediately. <br /><br />For this purpose I&#039;ve started on tracking their spines (red dots), therefor this mad cucaracha science. The first thing I want to do is put some tufts on their backs, for which I think I&#039;ll have to track the shoulders and find some sort of surface for the back. What&#039;s different here compared to the lizards is that these guys have a neutral (neither facing left nor right) position where they have their stomach to the camera, whereas the lizards have their backs to the camera in the neutral position. This might mean that I can&#039;t put colored decals on their back (because of overlapping issues) but will instead have to go with flat color stuff. We&#039;ll have to see how it goes though! </div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/074#1476">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

A colored field on their belly definitely brought some volume to their shape and made them appear as more of a creature and less of a flat color blob.

I count on sorting that out relatively quickly though, and then I&#039;ll just add some detail to them and the individualization phase will be done for now.

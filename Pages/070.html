Yesterday and today I&#039;m working on a creature that I won&#039;t announce here - because it&#039;s a fairly quick one (not to say it&#039;s not cool though <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />) I felt that this way you guys would get the most surprise per day of devlog silence, if you get me.<br /><br />There are a few creatures in the game now that haven&#039;t made it to the internet - not very many at all, but hopefully enough to make the actual game a bit exciting even for you most veteran devlog readers come release. <br /><br />Normal posts start again tomorrow!</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/070.html#1381">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

I&#039;ve made a bunch of sketches today, but I think it&#039;s more fun for you guys to see it develop from the good old red dots, so here we go:<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/Sg23W.png" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />More red dots attached tomorrow!<br /><br />In other news, James has been able to assemble the current region, and it&#039;s looking good! This one will be sort of the final stretch in the game, and because of that we&#039;ve decided to go more linear - instead of the standard sprawling rooms it&#039;s supposed to be more of an epic journey where you push through and have to fight for every step along the way. The Daddy Long Legs have proven to put up a bit of a too rough fight though it seems, so that&#039;s going to need a little tuning. James tells me they eat everything and clear the rooms - I haven&#039;t seen it myself but I can certainly believe it! This is standard stuff after getting a region together though, and we&#039;ll be able to sort it out pretty quickly.</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/070.html#1382">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

The updated version of the Daddy acts like a scary creature rather than a giant impassible scrub brush of death. Joar fixed their movement, added a very cool &quot;thunder-blindness&quot; disruption, and some tweaking to the ecosystem interactions helped out quite a bit. With these chaotic systems its such an odd balance. One seemingly minor tweak has huge implications for play. In this case, Joar made the the Tube Worms quieter, which completely affected how the sound-hunting Daddies behaved in large rooms. <br /><br />Sort of along those lines, one of my favorite emergent encounters yet happened in this region. Of course I had planned plenty of &quot;set-piece&quot; style encounters in this region, hives of yellows, death-defying platform swinging around daddies, etc., and all that went off really well, but the one ive been having the most fun is of course the one that happened completely by accident: <br /><br />In the first few Underhang rooms are a sub-region called &quot;the legs&quot;, where you climb the interior of a large support column. The platforming is pretty tricky, its where you first encounter the tube worm grappling mechanic, so i kept is fairly free of predators, but since its a decent stretch of the map, just for fun a threw in 2 white lizards to spice it up a little. The geometry here is ideal for them, but i didnt realize how good it was going to be. It basically turns into a 10 screen climbing duel with the whites, fighting to climb from platform to platform and swinging around their tongues, knocking them off platforms with rocks, only to have them scramble back up after you. Then all the noise attracts a daddy of course, and it turns into complete mayhem just as the rains start to fall...<br /><br />Now thats in there permanently and im taking full credit for it <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/cheesy.gif" alt="Cheesy" border="0" /><br /><br />Anyway, Underhang is a wrap for now, so on to region 11!</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/070.html#1384">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

By this point James is way past black belt in level design, and the rooms have super fun platforming challenges that work really really well with the creatures. The rooms having multiple paths through them has been standard for some time, but for this region he&#039;s taken it to the next level by building the rooms to be dual purpose, each is essentially a level for rain world and a level for whatever game it becomes when you pick up a grappling hook - with the ability to switch between the two at any point. And most of them have multiple routes even within those&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/shocked.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /><br /><br />To sort of give you an idea there&#039;s this room that has daddy long legs crawling about, a bunch of tube worms, and a pretty big pack of yellow lizards. Daddies like large open spaces, the yellow lizards like maze like structures where they can do a lot of flanking and surrounding their prey. Standard slugcat likes platforms and poles, slugcat with grappling hook likes smaller floating pieces of terrain to grapple and swing from. The room is 10 screens large, with all of these environments flowing in and out of each other, here and there with overlaps that force the creatures to encounters. Throughout the entire thing are multiple grappling hook routes and routes for when you&#039;re without the hook, some of them sharing certain passages and then diverging again. All of them however come together at a bottleneck in the middle of the room, forcing you to move through all the different little sub-environments and be subjected to their critters. This means that you&#039;re sort of forced to go through most of the room, but you can still shape your experience depending on your resources and preferences. Amazing level design!</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/070.html#1385">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

And still ... not ... quite ... there. But, I&#039;ll move on for now, maybe the later stuff I add will magically make it work. <br /><br />As you can see from the gif it has two modes, one when staying still or moving short distances, and then a sprint.

The trick is actually that it&#039;s <i>not </i>a ragdoll, so it doesn&#039;t need to find balance etc. To clarify - if I was using the &quot;animate a ragdoll&quot; method, I would start out with a thing that was limp on the ground, but behaving correctly in terms of physics. Then I&#039;d have to make forces pull at this thing, and I&#039;d have to worry about a million things such as balance. <br /><br />Instead I work backwards - I start out with a pretty typical &quot;game&quot; movement, a thing that just swishes through the air following the A*. Then I put legs on it, then I make the legs seek contact with the ground. Then I make it so that when the legs are not in contact with the ground, the body is affected by a bit of gravity. Basically I start out with a movement that has nothing to do with physical correctness but which works, and then I add cosmetic details that makes it appear more physically correct. But it&#039;s all fake - the legs of these birds for example doesn&#039;t consist of the same &quot;matter&quot; as their bodies but are just 2D vectors with no weight etc.<br /><br />A lot of the behaviors look really sloppy! That&#039;s why it&#039;s cool to be in this fantasy world with these fantasy creatures. If I were to animate a human looking figure like this I wouldn&#039;t get away with it for 2 seconds, but as no-one knows what these creatures are supposed to move like their sloppy scrambling might pass for correct.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1183766#msg1183766">Quote from: tortoiseandcrow on September 27, 2015, 06:03:42 PM</a></div><div class="quote">Reminds me of sligs from the Oddworld games.

This is sort of what we&#039;re going for though ... by not giving away much information in the game about what&#039;s going on except from what you see on the screen, we can get the player to project their own ideas onto the world, and you&#039;ll end up with a nice blurry line between what the game <i>can </i>do and what you <i>think </i>the game can do &nbsp;<img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /><br /><br /><b>Update 482</b><br /><br />UI for placing ambient sounds. <br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/ConstantImprobableCivet.gif" alt="" width="700" height="419" border="0" /><br /><br />Just UI so far ~ no, you know... sounds.</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/070.html#1394">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

The 1% lighting blend difference between rooms matters to me! XD<br /><br />really looking forward to it. my only sadness is that i cant dive right in just yet.

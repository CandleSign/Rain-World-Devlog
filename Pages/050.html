The CC region is situated between 3 other distinct regions and had a bunch strong ideas we wanted to explore, both visually and geometry-wise. Plus the Vulture came out so strong that we wanted to dedicate some serious space to that. Trying to make all these components work together and have a coherent look/feel was quite a challenge! <br /><br />Early in the game world planning stage, this region was to have around 15 screens, but as it is put together now it has 59(!!!) bringing the total number of screens for the first 4 regions to 192(!!!!), or close to what I had assumed would be for the entire game&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/cry.gif" alt="Cry" border="0" /> That said, I think Joar and I both agree this region is the the strongest yet, and its really fun to play. From my perspective the larger the world the better, so I&#039;m thinking its worth all the time spent banging my head against the wall!

That essentially means moving the vulture around through abstract space at semi-random until it comes upon something, like the player. The vulture stays a little bit in each room before moving on, which in the case of realized rooms is usually spent on the edge of the room or slightly outside it. So you can actually see the shadow of one of them sweep by and be successful in hiding, in which case it&#039;ll move on to the next room.<br /><br />I think that when sound goes in, it could be pretty nice to have some sound cue when they enter the room, so you get a chance to scurry under cover.<br /><br />Technically the vulture is able to &quot;teleport&quot; from anywhere to anywhere, but I&#039;ve tried to cluster the prey search a little bit. Essentially it works like this - it picks the room it&#039;s in, and searches it. Then it searches the neighboring rooms (as connected by actual connections, if you count sky highway all rooms are &quot;neighbors&quot;) and search them in a random order. When done, it repeats this process - but this time current room will be one of the neighbors. So, that way it&#039;ll vacuum the environment at semi-random, and hopefully there&#039;ll be a feel that it &quot;is in an area&quot; rather than wildly teleporting around.<br /><br />There is a 1/10 chance though that it&#039;ll just take off to any sky accessible room, to mix stuff up a little bit.<br /><br />As the vulture is a beast performance wise, I think I&#039;ll also add some kind of inter-species grumpyness to them. Two of them can run simultaneously on my computer, but when three are tentacling around it can get a little framy, so having them prefer not to all hang out in the same spot might be a good idea. <br /><br />Soon James will have his hands on the first vulture build, and you guys can hear his first impressions <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0" /> </div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/050.html#985">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

Would probably go under the same framework as lizard infighting, which I haven&#039;t gotten to yet. But it&#039;s a confirmed feature!<br /><br />I also had this idea that if you hit the Vulture in the head it could lose its mask, and an unmasked individual would be attacked by other vultures. Still haven&#039;t really decided on that one though.<br /><br /><b>Update 394</b><br /><br />Working on vulture-lizard interaction. Here&#039;s a gif, there&#039;s quite a bit going on here so I&#039;ll do some explaining below ~<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/pVyHQ.gif" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />What the heatmap shows is the anticipated threat level for each tile in the lizard&#039;s threat tracker (note that I don&#039;t <i>store </i>this data, I generate it on the fly. So the framerate drops quite a bit with this visualization, but when the AI uses it it doesn&#039;t ask for every tile, just for relevant ones).<br /><br />The lizard is inside the little box, which is open in both ends. This box is a sort of temporary shelter, because the vulture can reach in there with its neck - but it&#039;s juuust short of being able to reach the whole width of the box.<br /><br />Basically the lizard merges two sets of data to get this map, the distance to the threat (naturally) and an Accessibility Map. See how the tiles close to terrain are bluer? And the tiles inside the box as well? That&#039;s one of the pre baked AI maps, the Accessibility Map, for the vulture. It allows the lizard to understand that inside the box is more safe than outside it. As you can see it&#039;s staying in the box, although nervously. <br /><br />Also you might notice that all terrain has some bluer tiles around it - that&#039;s just because the vulture is big and close-to-terrain tiles are considered inaccessible to it for that reason. This might actually need fixing, because just because the vulture&#039;s center of mass can get close to a floor doesn&#039;t mean its neck is unable to.<br /><br />The amount with which the Accessibility Map weights in on the final threat map scales with distance. You can see this particularly clearly when the vulture moves down towards the lower-right platform, the &quot;safety&quot; of the tiles surrounding the platform is removed.<br /><br />This is the same effect that also finally drives the lizard out of the box. When the vulture does its peek-a-boo over at the left side, it&#039;s much closer and the safety of the box interior is disrupted. Now the danger gradient inside the box is steep enough for it to be worth it to dash for the other exit. So the lizard goes for it and heads for the room exit up in the corner instead.<br /><br />You can also see how the lizard&#039;s perception of the vulture&#039;s position is only updated when there&#039;s visual contact, which is why the heatmap is static while the vulture is moving below the box. In actuality the map shouldn&#039;t be <i>still </i>during that time, it should move with a Ghost of the vulture that the lizard tracks. But right now the Tracker has some problems with creatures that can move on big 2D planes - it considers each tile 4-way branch and immediately spawns up ghosts to follow all of them, hits the ghost cap and makes the ghosts stop. So it becomes more of a simple &quot;where did I last see the creature&quot; kind of thing. I&#039;ll get around to it.</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/050.html#986">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

The path finder, in turn, may take the creature on one route or another, which influences the Tracker by having the creature see or not see other creatures. The tracker influences the threat tracker ~~~ And each of these steps interact with some other modules as well. Debugging is always a delight.<br /><br /><b>Update 395</b><br />Cleaning up some vulture stuff, mainly. I&#039;ve been trying to have the vulture picking up the player, and make its way with the player back to its den with the camera following it. I&#039;m getting there, I hope, but there are some problems still. The vulture seems to have trouble actually finding its way to the den once entering a room. My theory is that this is because the room does abstract space path finding even though it&#039;s actually realized...

I suppose you&#039;re not doing that each frame as it would probably be overkill. Do you do it in the same game loop as the rest of the &quot;brain&quot; of the creature or are you using a different thread for such operations?<br /><br /></div><br />It starts at where it last saw the creature, and moves in the creatures last seen movement direction. At each division in the path, it creates a copy, meaning that the more the path forks the more copies, which is why an open plane makes it hit the cap right away. Copies that go in directions similar to the last seen direction get a higher score, as well as copies generally closer to the last seen position, and some other factors.<br /><br />The path finding algorithm doesn&#039;t really do cycles as in calculating an entire path and then wait a couple of frames - rather it churns along constantly as the game is running, meaning that the creature is following one path as the next is being generated. Path cells have a &quot;generation&quot; parameter, and the creature always follows the newest paths. <br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/Ed03H.gif" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1109049#msg1109049">Quote from: Teod on February 10, 2015, 02:42:26 AM</a></div><div class="quote"><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1108643#msg1108643">Quote from: JLJac on February 09, 2015, 06:17:33 AM</a></div><div class="quote">Yeah def!

Masked Vultures fight not to kill, but to establish dominance: once they understand who&#039;s stronger, the weaker one leaves. Unmasked Vulture is a target they want to kill.<br /><br />Although, to be honest, losable mask doesn&#039;t really make a good sense from biology perspective, especially if it brings such serious consequences for the creature. It would be more sensible if it could become cracked, which would make creature lose recognition and force previously established social position to be re-established, forcing more fights between them.<br /><br />Alternatively, you could use detachable mask not as much as debuff of the vulture (you lose position in the hierarchy, but you&#039;re not hunted to death), but as a rare item for the player. I imagine it being used to scare other creatures away.<br /></div><br />This is a good idea, though I think the subtlety of lethal/non lethal combat between non-player entities might really be lost in the wind. Maybe if they both have masks they could &quot;dance&quot; to establish who gets to scram, but if the mask is off it becomes actual fighting. Buuuuuut this is extra cool stuff, not something to get into when crunching a convention build.<br /><br />I sent this mockup to James a while ago:<br /><br /><table style="background-color:#b090a040; border:1px solid #ffffff; padding:5px"><td><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/LOST IMAGE.png" width="150px" alt="" border="0"/></td></table><br /><br />but I don&#039;t quite know.

Joar&#039;s concept is the entire world active as a constant interactive and autonomous ecosystem that is steadily roiling around in the background as you play through: creatures hunting creatures in distant lands as you make your way through, so by the time you arrive all manner of unexpected strangeness has happened. All that effort spent in the engine creation months ago on abstracting off-screen AI behavior to state descriptions was to make this concept (hopefully) CPU feasible when scaled up. <br /><br />Hiccups in this 4-region test aside, i think thats still generally the game plan. There may not *really* be a need for the game to keep track of 600ish eventual rooms filled with creatures existing at every moment though, so thats something to get a plan for. But, ideally we could tackle that at a time when we&#039;re not already super crunching to get a stable build together for PAX&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/tired.gif" alt="Tired" border="0" /><br /><br />back to questions about the interconnected map stuff, if you are interested here is an older working concept world map. things have evolved far enough from this that im comfortable sharing it without fear of spoilers or anything, and it shows you the general idea of the large interconnected world:<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/Yxr9VCal.jpg" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />Each color represents a region, and each square a screen, with grouped squares being multi-screen rooms. The regions geographically located next to each other are all connected, but there are also a number of fast-travel-esque connections between distant regions as well. The concept is that each room is a sort of movement puzzle to get through, and each region is its own puzzle of those puzzles, exploring various gameplay elements, geometries and creature territories, and then to get through the world you basically have to navigate a puzzle of puzzle of puzzles.<br /><br />But as it is now, the 4 regions we currently have hooked up are roughly equivalent in size and complexity to the scope of this entire map!&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/shocked.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> <br /><br />i think the final version will probably keep people occupied for a while.</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/050.html#995">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

More like, a fourth. So ... That&#039;s that. This thing is gonna be vast o___0<br /><br /><b>Update 396</b><br /><br />I&#039;ve been running the MEGA WORLD today, and doing some profiling etc. My basic take away is that at this size, it would be theoretically possible to have the entire world run simultaneously, but it&#039;s really an edge case - and with more content coming up, we&#039;re going to have to divide it somehow. Either that or some sort of lazy loading of rooms. I&#039;m not all that keen on either, because they do mean more systems that can entangle themselves in other systems, bug out, etc etc. The cleanest possible solution for this would be best. Abstract space/realized space division is already a mess, and adding one more layer of abstraction like that seems bad. <br /><br />What slows stuff down is basically two things: creatures finding paths offscreen, which is kind of expected and not very problematic - I&#039;ve not optimized that stuff at all, and there&#039;s potentially a lot that can be done - and loading of rooms files from the folder. This latter one puzzles me. It should take exactly as long to load a file whether there&#039;s a big world or a small world hanging out in RAM, to my knowledge. <br /><br />The other weird thing is this - if I have a small world, and 5 rooms realized in it, everything runs as supposed to. But a huge world, with <i>still only 5 rooms</i>, it will spend twice as long updating <i>those rooms</i>. In the method&#039;s &quot;self&quot; - not delegating anywhere. I have no idea what&#039;s going on here. Could it be that having all of the abstract rooms in RAM somehow... idk, makes the processor slower? The rooms already have waaaay more data stored in their AI maps than the abstract rooms put together can ever compare to, so it really is an enigma.<br /><br />Other than that, fixing, brushing up, sorting out. Today I spent some time messing with bats getting stuck at room borders, which became a lot of trouble in the new Chimney Canopy area which has a lot of open room borders. Also tried to make bats get stuck less in terrain and look overall a little more competent. Don&#039;t know quite how successful I was, but some stuff got better, definitely.<br /><br />And, widescreen:<br /><br /><a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/A1cXR.png" target="_blank"><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/A1cXR.png" alt="" width="270" height="150" border="0" /></a><br /><br />Playing in widescreen is pretty damn sweet actually! It feels like my eyes were opened for the very first time! I&#039;ll probably never be able to go back without suffering horrible claustrophobia. <br /><br />Still some work to do on the widescreen stuff - water isn&#039;t completely comfortable with it yet, and the shaders need a little bit of adaption.</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/050.html#996">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

Actually putting together a region and getting a feel for the scale we wanted to convey was much more important than my little boxy map sketch <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> Once we had the SU map put together it was pretty apparent that this was the way things were going to go.<br /><br />so Joar just mentioned the widescreen addition casually in the last update, but WOW was that a huuuuuuuuuge addition. The entire game has been built around 16:9 format from the start, the geometry of every room and screen was structured around it, but I think we were so used to our little 4:3 alpha window that we didnt even realize what we were missing. Fortunately our earlier selves planned this out well! <br /><br />Long story short: the game plays SO MUCH BETTER in 16:9, how its supposed to be. You see paths and lizards and creatures that were previously off-screen, sometimes before they see you, giving you time to plan actual sneaks or escapes like you are supposed to! Plus you can finally really watch the ecosystem interactions that Joar has been working forever on, things like spotting a vulture and waiting for it to to swoop down on a group of pink lizards before you make your move through a tricky room, etc.<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/WS8l119l.png" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />Plus the scale just POPS. I&#039;ve been building these rooms in 16:9 but other than in a little schematic preview window in the editor, havent been able to see the full picture until now. tears of joy&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/tearsofjoy.gif" alt="Tears of Joy" border="0" /><br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/SJlB0WPl.png" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />This does, however, mean that I now have tons of touching up to do on the levels. Surprisingly (to me!) most look prettttty good, but there are definitely a few that have un-tiled portions or some other unfinished aspect out there in the wings where I couldn&#039;t see before. Also, it highlights a few other ares of roughness like the camera switching which could use some polish.<br /><br />But that said, HUGE step forward.<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/ojaBL2Rl.png" alt="" border="0" /></div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/050.html#998">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

So its probably good that we spent as much time with 4:3 as we did.

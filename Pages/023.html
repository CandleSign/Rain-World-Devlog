By all accounts, that would be the best thing for Rain World, BUT its expensive and tedious, so we&#039;d need to make sure that the resources are in place first and its, well, not completely impossible.

Sorry I haven&#039;t been around much lately, there has been quite a lot to do.<br /><br />Let me clarify a little what we&#039;ve been thinking about this. Very obviously, moving to another dev environment will set me back. But there are some arguments for it that I find kind of compelling:<br /><br />* The three years of development has not been full time, rather it has averaged at something like 1 hour a day. Also it&#039;s not three years - yes, the first prototypes for character movement etc were initiated a little earlier - but then the project rested for some time, and active development didn&#039;t start until early 2012, two years ago. So in the absolute worst case scenario, where it takes exactly as long to re-make the game as it has taken to write it the first time, we get 2 years / 8 which give us about 3 months of full time work. Aaaand...<br /><br />* A major chunk of my development time goes towards finding solutions for complicated problems such as path finding, through iteration, and fine tuning animation stuff, through iteration. If I&#039;m porting the game, I wouldn&#039;t need to spend 4 hours determining whether that jump force should be 1.2 or 1.4 by playtesting over and over, I could just grab the number from my old game and move ahead. <br /><br />* An undetermined but monstrous amount of time has gone to creating the level editor/renderer. Perhaps we would like to port the level editor too, but it&#039;s not strictly necessary. If the schedule becomes tight we can as well use the old one.<br /><br />* Another sizable amount of time has been put towards making art assets for the level editor, and making levels. Some of this work could also be redone if we have the luxury of extra time, but could as well be skipped. A little bit of conversion code could make the old levels/level editor projects work just fine.<br /><br />* Anything is better than Director. For three generations I&#039;ve feared that newest version of windows wouldn&#039;t support Director applications. Lingo is a dead language, we need to move to something that we can count on continuing to exist for a few years into the future. Plus, updates, and active help boards on forums! I imagine googling for a problem and finding something else than a post from 2005 with no answer. <br /><br />* The things we listed in the kickstarter update. I too like the single room layout, and the game idea is pretty much based around it, so it&#039;ll probably stay. But imagine how awesome to have these things by choice, rather than necessity! Maybe some rooms in the hub world could be a little bigger, with a scrolling screen, to convey scale? Maybe we could have water? Maybe we could have this really big impressive room where 400 flies are swarming? I don&#039;t want to turn this into a gears of war spectacular effects fest - I just want to expand my choices a little bit so I can do the things I want to do without having to worry about how many milliseconds fatter each frame becomes. I&#039;ve always wanted to have dangling chains and plants that move a little as you pass them, but it&#039;s been impossible for technical reasons. I would be super happy if any of it became feasible. <br /><br />* Personal development. The current idea is that I would read up on the basics on whatever language we&#039;re moving too, and then sit next to the expert guy as we port it. During the process of us porting it together I&#039;ll learn the new tool. This way we don&#039;t only migrate Rain World to another language, we also migrate <i>me</i>. I already have some experience of different coding languages, and I tend to pick them up fairly quickly. So in the worst case scenario, where we aren&#039;t able to pay this guy for more time than it takes to port the thing up to where we are today, I can jump in and continue development from there myself. If it isn&#039;t the worst case scenario, we could continue to use this guy&#039;s expertise to further optimize the game and overcome technical limitations. <br /><br />Right now I can only have 1000 sprites on the screen at a time, and I&#039;ve had to cap the number of lizards at 4 because otherwise it ran too slowly, etc etc. I have managed to work with these limitations, and I have a working game. Also I&#039;m kind of fine with it, because I didn&#039;t intend for this game to be something with 100 enemies on the screen. But it would be cool if I knew that the choices I made was because of artistic license, not technical limitations. Also I trust myself to not put 100 enemies on the screen just because I can haha!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg986484#msg986484">Quote from: dancing_dead on January 21, 2014, 12:45:46 AM</a></div><div class="quote">I don&#039;t think it&#039;ll be that bad at all.

I want to have as few pre-made solutions for game stuff as possible, actually, because it will only collide with my code and become annoying when porting. I&#039;ve written all my collision logic etc myself, and it&#039;s far from perfect, but it&#039;s custom made and well integrated. I worry that some misaimed helpfulness would only slow me down.<br /><br />What do you recommend? I want something that&#039;s easy to learn, performs nicely, but doesn&#039;t come with a load of drag-and-drop stuff and physics engines etc. Just a good clean development environment.

No, bats don&#039;t hunt lizards, but they tend to flock around them because they enjoy picking on them, and because they know the risk of Slugcat ambush is smaller if they&#039;re hanging out next to a lizard.<br /><br />On the questions of the game world layout:<br />The game world consists of many interconnected rooms, that you can move between metroidvania style. Some of these rooms are &quot;swarm rooms&quot;, where the flies swarm and where you go to hunt. The swarm rooms can also be played as stand-alone challenges in custom mode. My idea has been that once you have traveled to a swarm room in world mode, it would be unlocked and appear in the menu of the custom mode game types.<br /><br />On lizard personalities:<br />Lizards come in a few breeds, identified by head colors. These all have different abilities and feats. Green is the &quot;tank&quot;, big, slow, lazy, stupid, but takes a lot of abuse. Blue is the &quot;ninja&quot; lizard, smallest in the family, with the least health, but with the ability to climb on walls and in ceilings, and with a sticky tongue it can shoot at you. Then there are a few others, and then there&#039;s red. If you see red, run&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/epileptic.gif" alt="Epileptic" border="0" /></div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/023.html#448">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

I might explore the possibility in the future though <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0" /><br /><br />I&#039;m starting to think more seriously about what development environment I should move to, and whether unity is a good idea or not. <br /><b>So, ever helpful and supportive community, would you mind throwing your advice this way?</b> I know that we did have some discussion about this earlier, but this time around I&#039;ll actually spell out what I need from the tool I&#039;m moving to:<br /><br />* Fairly quick to learn, fairly quick to write in. I need to spend as little time as possible learning the new language, and it can&#039;t be 10 minutes just to define a variable or something like that. Development has to be easy and quick. But...<br /><br />* <i>Not </i>drag-and-drop, no-code user interface, pre-defined behaviours, built in physics engines. I have written behaviors for things like collision physics etc already, and built-in engines doing that same stuff would do more damage than good. They&#039;d collide with the behaviors I already have, and make the porting slower by preventing me from doing straight transfers of the solutions I already have. I&#039;d have to solve problems again, rather than just move solutions. Still...<br /><br />* <i>Some </i>pre-defined stuff would be great, especially for rendering graphics. Like, rotating, stretching, changing the content of sprites etc. I don&#039;t know what&#039;s common practice, to have some kind of sprite system or to draw everything with some copy pixels like method to the screen each frame? In either case it would be great if rotating etc would be as easy as possible. Also, drawing simple vector graphics with bézier curves.<br /><br />* Other than that, I would prefer some pre-defined stuff for strictly technical tasks such as getting keyboard input, setting screen resolution, reading/writing to external files etc. That kind of stuff is not what I&#039;m interested in, and the less time I spend making the screen resolution reset code work on different computers or whatever, the better. <br /><br />* Good debugging. In director I can pause and look at the actual value of every specific variable, track variables in a window so I can see them change in real time, etc. When I&#039;ve been working in Adobe Flash I haven&#039;t found that stuff, and have had to rely only of the trace function for all that, which has been frustrating. I need better than a trace function.<br /><br />* Performance! I need to make <i>a lot</i> of calculations each frame, and don&#039;t want any slowdown.<br /><br />* A living community and continuous updates. I&#039;m tired of being the last dinosaur alive working on a software that I&#039;m never quite sure will run on the next version of windows. I want the environment and the community that works in it to be alive and healthy. <br /><br />So basically, I&#039;m not interested in building everything from the ground up just for the sake of it - I&#039;m super happy with using other peoples&#039; solutions for things like rotating sprites and getting keyboard input. But on the other hand, I don&#039;t want something klick&amp;play-like where I just tick a checkbox saying &quot;platformer movement&quot;, I need to fine tune more and I want to build more myself. Just a good, clean, easy, fast development environment where I build the game with code. Suggestions?

But...<br /><br />* <i>Not </i>drag-and-drop, no-code user interface, pre-defined behaviours, built in physics engines. I have written behaviors for things like collision physics etc already, and built-in engines doing that same stuff would do more damage than good. They&#039;d collide with the behaviors I already have, and make the porting slower by preventing me from doing straight transfers of the solutions I already have. I&#039;d have to solve problems again, rather than just move solutions. Still...<br /><br />* <i>Some </i>pre-defined stuff would be great, especially for rendering graphics. Like, rotating, stretching, changing the content of sprites etc. I don&#039;t know what&#039;s common practice, to have some kind of sprite system or to draw everything with some copy pixels like method to the screen each frame? In either case it would be great if rotating etc would be as easy as possible. Also, drawing simple vector graphics with bézier curves.<br /><br />* Other than that, I would prefer some pre-defined stuff for strictly technical tasks such as getting keyboard input, setting screen resolution, reading/writing to external files etc. That kind of stuff is not what I&#039;m interested in, and the less time I spend making the screen resolution reset code work on different computers or whatever, the better. <br /><br />* Good debugging. In director I can pause and look at the actual value of every specific variable, track variables in a window so I can see them change in real time, etc. When I&#039;ve been working in Adobe Flash I haven&#039;t found that stuff, and have had to rely only of the trace function for all that, which has been frustrating. I need better than a trace function.<br /><br />* Performance! I need to make <i>a lot</i> of calculations each frame, and don&#039;t want any slowdown.<br /><br />* A living community and continuous updates. I&#039;m tired of being the last dinosaur alive working on a software that I&#039;m never quite sure will run on the next version of windows. I want the environment and the community that works in it to be alive and healthy. <br /><br />So basically, I&#039;m not interested in building everything from the ground up just for the sake of it - I&#039;m super happy with using other peoples&#039; solutions for things like rotating sprites and getting keyboard input. But on the other hand, I don&#039;t want something klick&amp;play-like where I just tick a checkbox saying &quot;platformer movement&quot;, I need to fine tune more and I want to build more myself. Just a good, clean, easy, fast development environment where I build the game with code. Suggestions? Is unity my match?<br /></div><br />@JubJub from the looks of it, basically all I&#039;d use would be the 2d graphics stuff, yeah. My friend just suggested C#, SFML + Mono, MonoDevelop, instead, and I&#039;ve been looking up C# and feel like I kind of like it. There are other technical stuff I worry about though, such as memory leaks etc. Maybe Unity would take care about that stuff for me? As said, I&#039;m not thrilled to spend time creating intricate technical solutions for problems that have been solved a thousand times before just for the sake of it, I&#039;d rather work on the game. <br /><br />@Christian, that&#039;s exactly how it works. Players compete either in lethal combat or in competitive play (catching the most flies and staying alive) and the lizards hunt them as a &quot;neutral&quot; threat. If you hit the other player with a rock so that s/he is eaten by a lizard, you get a kill.<br /><br />@Bandreus, that sounds cool! How does debugging work with that? Are there libraries for doing stuff such as rotating sprites etc? I&#039;m not interested in re-inventing the wheel here. I do have some experience with ActionScript and Javascript, and I think they are pretty much exactly the same as Lingo, so those transitions hasn&#039;t been hard.</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/023.html#450">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

But I can use C# with Unity as well, right? Couldn&#039;t I write my game in unity/C#, and basically use almost none of the unity built-in stuff, but instead use unity&#039;s debugging, etc? For those things I want, I could use the stuff JIMBERT listed, and the stuff I want to do myself I can do myself. And get the multi platform stuff as well...?<br /><br />I won&#039;t move to XNA, because I don&#039;t want to move from one dead language to another. <br /><br />Noogai03, why do you hate sfml? Is it unable to do stuff, or is it just personal preference?<br /><br />In the end, I think what I will do is to download 2 or 3 of them, give them a day or two each, and try them out. Mocking up pong or something. But it&#039;d be nice to narrow down the alternatives so these trials can eat away as little as possible from actual development time.<br /><br /><br /><br />One of the things I&#039;ve always wanted to have in Rain World is dynamic shadows. Seeing your shadow play over the objects in the background would do soooo much for immersion, because suddenly these things would not just be a flat background image, they&#039;d be part of the same world as you. I&#039;m having ideas about how to implement this, and would like to hear what you guys think about the ideas in relation to the choice of development tool.<br /><br /><b>Doing it for real</b><br />Currently a Rain World level consists of 30 layers of graphics, of which the first 5 are baked together into a foreground image (in front of game sprites) and the remaining 25 are baked together into a background (behind game sprites).<br /><br />What if I didn&#039;t paste all these together, but kept them as 30 separate sprites in the game? And had them all cast shadows on each other, in real time. Then it would be as simple as implementing the sprite layer as one of them, between #5 and #6. <br /><br />Maybe shadow calculation could be done as it currently is in the level editor, with a &quot;light image&quot; which is used as a mask for each layer to decide where it uses the sun/shade palettes, and to which each layer adds its silhouette in black so as to cast a shadow on layers behind. But each frame, rather than in a minute long rendering process. <br /><br /><b>Built-in dynamic light stuff</b><br />Or maybe there is some kind of built in shader for this kind of stuff in for example unity, that runs much faster? In that case, would it work with my resolution, no anti-aliasing, exactly the colors I want etc?<br /><br /><b>Depth map light</b><br />This one is really theoretical. I save a depth map for all pixels that are sunlit as I render the level. Say that the light source is top-left. Now say that we want to know if pixel (432, 122) is sunlit. The depth of (432, 122) is 7. Now we step seven pixels to the left and seven pixels left, and see if this specific pixel is occupied by a sprite (because we have drawn all the sprites to a bitmap each frame, I guess) and if it is, we color pixel (432, 122) according to the shade palette rather than the sun palette. Stuff that is further back in the depth map is shadowed by things that are further to the left/up, making the shadows play over the objects as supposed to without having to bother about the static elements that are the same each frame.<br /><br />Could maybe be made less processor intense (but more RAM-demanding) if you had one mask for each depth layer, and just applied the sprite silhouettes to those with different offsets. There would be 25 masks... Idk, this one probably wouldn&#039;t work.<br /><br />Other ideas?</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/023.html#451">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

That stuff would get in the way and become a huge problem for me. But you say it&#039;s possible to just turn it off and use only the things I like? Having sprites in different layers for example would be kind of neat.<br /><br />The camera stuff as well - I don&#039;t want that. If I need that I&#039;ll do that myself. I worry that it&#039;ll chip away at performance simply by *actually being a 3D camera* though I don&#039;t use any of that functionality.<br /><br />Edit: like, it runs slower because it <i>could</i> do a bunch of things I don&#039;t actually do. Like, the fact that it has the potential to zoom slows the rendering down compared to if that function didn&#039;t even exist, which would be preferable if I never use it.</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/023.html#453">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

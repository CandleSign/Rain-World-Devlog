This time I&#039;m rolling a hybrid between the old tentacle code and the new rope physics developed for the tube worm - the tentacle behavior is similar to the vulture, but the rope physics engine is used to connect the segments of the legs making them a bit more solid when it comes to terrain interaction. These very long legs were sort of unforgiving visually as you&#039;d see any movement through terrain clearly, but this combination of methods seems to be something I think I can make look good.</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/069#1363">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

I have to say, this game has this incredible voyeuristic quality, where simply watching the different creatures is just fascinating. After my slugcat gets killed, I tend to watch for a few more minutes to watch lizards fight over the carcass or fight each other. It&#039;s so cool.<br /><br />I&#039;d love to have a separate mode to enjoy that without having to worry about the coming rain or other dangers<br /><br />Like a mode titled &quot;Vivarium&quot; or something like that <br /></div><br />yes definitely! we were actually just talking about that a little bit. in the old Lingo alpha, multiplayer and sandbox were combined, so you could throw creatures and players into levels of your choosing and just go at it. what were planning now is a bit of an elaboration on that, tying in the narrative portion of the game so as you explore the world in single player / co-op, you are unlocking new content (rooms, regions, creatures, etc) for use in the multiplayer/sandbox mode. this will get us a lot of extra mileage from fun stuff like the water elements, tube worm grapple, cicada jumps, etc., that otherwise would just be confined to a region or two.<br /><br />but more related to your question, i know Joar is super keen on having some sort of ecosystem observation mode, so a &quot;vivarium&quot; that pulls from these same elements sounds perfecto.<br /><br /><br /><br />Also hey hello hi im back from PAX!

Violence as a messy last resort when everything else fails - never a goal in its own right.<br /><br /><b>Update 469</b><br /><br />More daddy long legs work. The locomotion still has some wonks, but it&#039;s getting better. This creature has a new challenge - it&#039;s more procedural than most because this time around the body shape and the amount/length of the tentacles are randomized as well, not only cosmetic details. This introduces the difficulty of not knowing exactly what the body I&#039;m writing locomotion code for will look like, but at the end of the day the general body plan is always similar enough for it to work - chunky body in the middle, halo of tentacles around it.<br /><br />This creature will use its tentacles to grab, and today I did some work on making it reach into narrow spaces to try to pull you out. What&#039;s tricky about this is making it able to think about how to interact with spaces it&#039;s not actually allowed in itself. The solution I&#039;m going with is to rely on the tentacle pathfinding I already have - the tentacles are sort of autonomous and just gives the main AI some hints on how to make their activities easier. This autonomy should also bring with it the ability to hunt two or more different prey with different tentacles at the same time.<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/GiddyDefiniteBactrian.gif" alt="" border="0" /></div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/069#1366">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

Joar has had the framework for this system in for quite a while actually, and the effects can be seen currently in the behaviors of the cicadas and the jetfish. But its one of those numbers things that&#039;s probably going to require a bit of fussing with and balancing to make it work well, so we will get into that more when we&#039;re in the polish phase, where the world is complete, creatures are done and we have this big ecosystem web of creature behaviors to mess with.

If I understand correctly I think this is basically what I&#039;m doing, except I can&#039;t just calculate leg positions for the final position, but have to do it continuously along the way to get there as well.

Also I have a basic system for dividing tasks between tentacles so that only tentacles not strictly necessary for locomotion are tasked with hunting etc. On a floor it could be pretty cool that the creature in some tense moment abandoned locomotion and collapsed to the floor, using all tentacles to hunt. However, Underhang architecture is all about ceilings and death pits below, and in a context like that it has to be always supporting itself.<br /><br />James and I had a quick talk on creature design. As it&#039;s coming along, the daddy long legs has slow body movement, but pretty quick tentacle movement (which can&#039;t easily be turned down because it also uses them for climbing, and then the body would be <i>even </i>slower) and super long range. This means that basically the creature becomes a slow moving little thing with a screen-sized orb of death around it, which is a problem as it will make it practically impossible to move through the rooms.<br /><br />We talked a little about this issue and came up with a solution that I think is both gameplay appropriate and pretty cool. The idea is that the daddy is blind, instead it uses hearing and its sense of touch to hunt you. When you collide with the tentacles it will be made aware of you, but not immediately grab you. If it hears something move, it will send a tentacle over there to feel around and check it out. This creates a reason for it to make sense that the creature is basically only long legs - it sits in some corner spreading its legs out throughout the room like a spider&#039;s web, and when something moves through there it tries to grab it and move it towards its center. <br /><br />I&#039;ve gotten started on this alternative sensory system by making it blind, but give it hearing (just turning on the hearing module, yay modular AI!) and make it able to &quot;see&quot; creatures that are overlapping its tentacles. Seems to work, but is so far a little unpredictable which is cool because it makes the creature feel alien, but definitely makes it harder to play against. Will need some tweaking.<br /><br />Next up is making it able to send a tentacle to check out an unknown sound. This means that tentacles need to be able to switch between three tasks, Locomotion, Hunting and Examination. The tasks should also be prioritized in that order. More visually interesting updates tomorrow!</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/069#1368">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

Not finished yet, but lots of progress today.<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/PlainSlightGilamonster.gif" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />First of all, I smoothed the tentacles out with a bezier curve. Bezier curves are actually super easy if you&#039;re familiar with 2D lerping. <br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/240px-Bézier_3_big.gif" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />As you can see from this wikipedia gif, it&#039;s just lerping from one thing to the other, then lerping from that to another lerp point, etc ~ Lots of lerps basically!<br /><br />Tentacles still have some issues with vibrating back and forth. That&#039;s not in the skin but in the actual tentacle behavior - however I think I can perhaps solve it in the skin by just checking for repeating positions and ignore them. We&#039;ll see what&#039;s easiest. <br /><br />The creature will also get some detail on its body.<br /></div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/069#1373">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

I don&#039;t have to make the thing look like some sketch or some original idea, if the spider looks cooler as an octopus halfway through, I can make it an octopus <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0" /><br /><br />The idea for this creature is that it&#039;s sort of both spider and spider&#039;s web.

Working with the yellow lizards I got annoyed with them getting stuck in corners, so I dove into some of the old lizard movement stuff, trying to make it smoother. Problem is that the code is a year and a half by now, and not so great. Soooo a lot of messing around just in order to understand what I was even looking at. After a lot of work I managed to get the thing done I had set my mind to, but I can&#039;t tell for sure if it&#039;s a great improvement. However, I&#039;ve been tidying up that old code a bit and refreshed my memory on it, for whatever that&#039;s worth &nbsp;<img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/shrug2.gif" alt="Shrug" border="0" /></div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/069#1379">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div><br></body>

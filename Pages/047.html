Yeah, I&#039;m really happy about the near-surface distortion as well <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0" /> It&#039;s actually just the horizontal distortion that&#039;s present everywhere in the water that gets increased with an exponent near the surface. For the caustics (thanks for teaching me that word) - actually they are not the same color as the static highlights, it&#039;s just the gif format that bakes them together. So the wall distortion thing you saw is probably not as bad in the actual game. As for the shader cycle speed, I want it to somewhat work with a pretty still surface as well as with an upset surface that you&#039;re currently swimming through, so I settled for a medium-ish speed. I <i>could </i>have it change speed depending on how tall the waves are, but I do tend to get caught up in little cosmetics like this forever, so I try to move on from that stuff at a reasonable time and get back to actual gameplay programming. Especially as if I know myself, walking down that road would mean having the speed be locally affected by the water below that specific place, and that seems like trouble :S<br /><br />@akryl9296<br />Awesome map! <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0" /> Bigger it&#039;s gonna be - this is one area of like, ten o___0 Remember also that this was the first area James did, so it&#039;s a bit experimental. Being the first area, and maybe the most loosely defined theme-wise, I&#039;d bet that this particular one is going to go through some pretty damn big changes before release! Sorry to say when you&#039;ve spent so much time on that map... Feedback is most welcome! Just remember that everything is super WIP. You can either post it here or PM me, depending on if you think it would be an interesting read to others as well <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0" /><br /><br /></div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/047#922">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

BUT then we could be lazy and not have to implement multiple slugcat shelters yet <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> <br /><br />per some of your later questions on it, the rain cycle in general is pretty much just a mock-up at this stage.<br /><br />2-7, 20-21. yep, controls are something that we will be spending some serious time on when the world is in a more feature-complete stage. There are a few aspects where we need to make some fairly significant design decisions on, which will inform how we tailor the controls (so no use messing with them until that point), but even from the lingo people have been on us about them XD<br /><br />8,9. the crawlspaces are one of those design decisions i was walking about. as its planned now, some of the more challenging subterranean regions begin to focus on a more tight crawly maze-like game play style, but until we are there and actually messing around with the creatures and geometries that we&#039;ll be using, no use in messing with it. <br /><br />Only somewhat related, but worth mentioning since were on the subject: crawling will not just be for entering tunnels, but also a &quot;stealthed&quot; silent movement which help you avoid AI detection, letting you sneak past predators and sneak up on prey.<br /><br />10. no worries on that! there are around 20 notable creatures, plus various NPCs and decorative fauna planned. (though to a degree the bleakness IS an aspect we are going for?)<br /><br />12,13,15,17,19. Plenty of work to do on the Lizard behavior for sure. Though I seriously doubt Joar will EVER get them to a place that he&#039;s 100% happy with them, haha. Although I have to take some of the blame for this, as the lizard AI reacts to the room geometries, and some of these alpha rooms are asking lizards to do things that they dont like to (sloped tiles, drops that are just out of their comfort zone, etc etc), which creates weird behavior.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1098521#msg1098521">Quote from: tortoiseandcrow on January 09, 2015, 10:03:08 AM</a></div><div class="quote"> <br />James &amp; Joar - Seeing it like that (though without having played the alpha), I am curious about the &quot;death drops&quot; that are on some screens.<br /></div><br />this is a good question that im kind of dealing with now. right now in the level editor we are limited to rendering rooms of 3 screen heights max. very soon Joar is going to fix that, so i think that &quot;fall off screen&quot; death drops will then only be in certain regions where it&#039;s called for (aerial regions, tall towers or deep pits, etc), plus perhaps the occasional scattering of them here and there just to be mean. Then we&#039;d obviously implement death if you fall a certain distance, etc., possibly anything greater than 2 screens.

Hiding in tunnels helps avoid them until they calm down, but should they find me out - I&#039;m dead, they&#039;re faster in tunnels than I am. That&#039;s why I mentioned the &quot;tight spaces&quot; - I meant tighter than standard tunnel, one that lizard can&#039;t fit into - would help survive, and since it&#039;s in map design, you still get to be mean here and there x) <br /></div><br />totally a possibility! we will definitely be balancing the tunneling speed of the cat and other creatures for sure, plus possibly adding some sort of tunneling &quot;move set&quot; for the cat (heck, we haven&#039;t even discussed regular slugcat moves here yet!), so you can maybe get short bursts of movement in tunnels. another possibility is objects (or creatures) that can be used to block tunnels. but again, this is all a bit ahead of us!<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Will there be more of such &quot;alpha&quot; releases on the way, just to see how the game is progressing? <br /></div><br />I think we&#039;d like to do at least one more before actual beta?

In the case of large rooms, which might be something like 1000 * 4000 pixels large, we get 1000 * 4000 * 30, and then * 4, because each layer keeps track of color for each pixel, shadow status for each pixel, and effect coloration. 1000 * 4000 * 30 * 4 pixels is more than director can handle it seems. So instead I&#039;ll try to make the level editor only render a voxel space for a little box around where the camera is for each screen, and get around those huge bitmaps.<br /><br />Q: Why is it dreaded?<br />A: Because it&#039;s boring. It&#039;s a looooot of work, and digging into old code, and the end result won&#039;t be exciting at all. In actuality it <i>will </i>be exciting when the game is actually played, because it&#039;ll allow us to create really big rooms, but on screenshots you guys won&#039;t be able to notice any difference.<br /><br />Q: Why now?<br />A: Because the earlier the better - James will have had access to better tools for a larger percent of dev time the earlier this gets done. Also the devlog has been dormant during my winter vacation thingie, and I figured it would be better to have it stay dormant for a while rather than wake it up and get you guys all hopeful, just to shut it down again. I won&#039;t devlog about the level editor overhaul, because it basically all boils down to &quot;In frustration I messed around with 3 years old lingo code in futile attempts to solve petty little problems in order to get to the exact same spot where the level editor already was, but this time with support for larger rooms&quot;.<br /><br />Also there will be some other level editor work, such as adding a Prop Editor where James can place some objects (say plants, cogs, chains) in the environment manually instead of trying to make the randomization of the Effect Editor hit the right spot by changing the seed over and over. And make the level loader understand sub-folders, and other exciting stuff.<br /><br />So, I&#039;m going to just go head first into this mess and try to survive through. Might be a couple of days!

Yeah this one is certainly venturing into some more alien territory. It&#039;s also pretty technically ambitious, even more than the lizard animation-wise, but it doesn&#039;t have the multiple breeds like the lizard does so it should be a bit easier to handle. I don&#039;t really have a solution for the devlog spoiler issue, as I kind of use the devlog as a tool for my personal motivation as well - if my progress is recorded somewhere else than just on my own computer it feels more like I&#039;m moving forward...<br /><br /><b>Update 380</b><br />Started setting up the framework for creature codename SKY KRAKEN. There&#039;s a creature template and all that now, as well as an actual physical representation that can move around a room with path finding. Everything is as usual just slightly more complex than what I can hold in my head at a time, but by breaking the problems down I keep getting around them. This time around I&#039;m also making a little &quot;setting up a creature instruction manual&quot;, which will hopefully speed up the process later by keeping me from doing stupid mistakes like spending 15 minutes debugging why the critter is just lying there, until I realize that I didn&#039;t spawn the AI module, etc.<br /><br />The tentacles will need some physics fiddling. Currently we have lizard tails, but those are completely limp and only 7 segments or so. These tentacles will be way bigger, and as they&#039;re not purely cosmetic they&#039;re going to need to be a little bit more robust in their terrain interaction. It can&#039;t be hand waved that two segments end up on opposite sides of a wall and the like. So now I&#039;m doing a thing where each segment is forcefully kept in the line of sight of the previous one - no terrain can be in between them. I&#039;m veering into Actual Physics Engine stuff here, and I&#039;m a complete amateur, so wish me luck lol! We&#039;ll see how it goes, worst case I&#039;ll have to simplify stuff a bit to get around the physics issues.</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/047#929">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

This is sort of exactly the intention: when you first encounter creatures they are terrifying, but as you learn their individual behaviors, they can become an asset.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1099958#msg1099958">Quote from: Christian on January 14, 2015, 09:30:40 AM</a></div><div class="quote">My only concern with a flying predator is that I kind of feel it might be overpowered compared to the slugcat. I mean, you&#039;re already feel outgunned and outnumbered with the lizards but there you can use your agility to outmaneuver them. A flying creature seems like it would negate the advantage your agility provides. How do you escape something like that?<br /></div><br />Flying creatures will have a massive advantage in certain terrains thats for sure, but will be unable to go through tunnels and tight spaces. Basically once you are below ground they arent really a threat. Lizards have much more terrain in common with the slugcat, so the more dangerous of the lizard breeds should actually be way more overpowered than the sky kraken, at least in terms of relative danger to the player. <br /><br />I mean, to clarify: this creature itself will be a complete terror. Sky Kraken is supposed to be Death From Above. But were thinking that clever level design and some as-of-yet unmentioned game mechanics will be the determining factor in keeping it manageable.

I feel in my element, and am at the same time not sure if I can do it. A nice challenge! After wasting half a day trying a proper physics engine solution that ended up glitching in infinity I decided to try something else, and am now doing the tentacles in tile space instead of float space, with the intention to overlay them with float space physics later. We&#039;ll see how it goes. Still nothing much to show, though progress is steady, so no gif yet. Hopefully I&#039;ll have some images for you tomorrow! Grabbing tentacles seems totally viable, although I think this critter might use them mainly for locomotion. But by this point I&#039;ve spent so much time on tentacle code that if this actually does work out, we&#039;ll definitely explore some other tentacle critter down the line. Will see how it pans out though, maybe sky kraken ends up grabby as well!</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/047#933">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

We have talked about having creating your own playable character as a reward - in that case there are two solutions I&#039;m willing to go with: <br /><br />Either the parameters of customization are <i>extremely </i>limited, basically just color. <br /><br />Or people are allowed to put sunglasses on their slugcats or whatever, but the content is purely cosmetic, and unlockable only through some kind of far fetched key combination or something, so other people won&#039;t have to hurt their eyes by seeing it. Or perhaps a text file with a code that unlocks that specific character. <br /><br />In this latter case you won&#039;t strictly have <i>the whole game accessible to everyone</i>, but it doesn&#039;t matter that much because all of the content you&#039;re missing out on is purely cosmetic, ridiculous and off-canon. You&#039;re not missing out on official game content, you&#039;re missing out on some dude&#039;s desire to play as a slugcat with Johnny Bravo hair, and that&#039;s not such a big tragedy in my eyes. <br /><br />When it comes to crossovers, my canon purism also applies, but some very subtle little references to other media is acceptable as easter eggs IMO. Like, finding a secret room with a little drawing on the wall that could be interpreted as a wink to some other game or something. </div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/021#400">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

It&#039;s very nice to see how concerned you all are about the success of our project :D<br /><br />I&#039;m putting a little bit of a lid on the devlog for a few days, in order to build up for the kickstarter release (and because I won&#039;t be doing as much work on the actual game). Michael who&#039;s on board as a sort of kickstarter consultant (care to introduce yourself, Michael?) has been telling me that it&#039;s better to not leak out any stuff on the side while making the preparations for a kickstarter. You don&#039;t want to release any pressure before the big opening of the flood gates. So hold tight people, and be excited about the kickstarter launch! <br /><br />Right now we don&#039;t exactly know what date we&#039;re going for, 9&#039;th is not entirely out of the question, but we could end up putting it a couple of days later as well. </div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/021#407">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

One thing that came out of that communication was that I was more able to define what I want - I want something that&#039;s sweet &amp; sour. Sweet as in cartoony, sour as in desolate. When doing these logos many people have been suggesting that I should more or less drop the sweet and go entirely sour - which I don&#039;t want. My problem, on the other hand, has been that what I&#039;ve made is entirely sweet, not good that either. For it to be an interesting taste it has to have booth.<br /><br />Michael works with an art collective, and they&#039;ve been helping me with a little feedback. You can&#039;t imagine how nice it is to have some kind of reality check, rather than just doing something and then staring blankly at it trying to figure out if it&#039;s good or not!<br /><br />One thing we came up with was, the same as many of you guys have been suggesting, to give the logo a bit of texture as if it was part of the environment and affected by the rain.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the latest (and hopefully final) version:<br /><br /><table class="lostimage"><td><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/LOST IMAGE.png" width="150px" alt="" border="0"/></td></table><br /><br />The cat is dropped, it added too much sweet. It will be featured only on the press page, making it more of an &quot;illustration&quot; rather than an integrated part of the logo.<br /><br />Michael and his artists didn&#039;t like the asian signs, but both James and I do, so we&#039;ll respectfully disregard that unless someone can come up with a killer argument to leave them out &nbsp;<img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /><br /><br />Still not 100% on the color - it looks less cute if you use for example blue instead of pink, but this pink/red is featured everywhere in the game&#039;s environments, and thus ties it together nicely. I&#039;ve tried to fade the color down some in order to not have it appear too sugary. </div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/021#418">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

Like, something that&#039;s liked by 90% of people has to be better in some way than something liked by 4% of people... or defining quality becomes very difficult. So I want to make something that&#039;s my own, but also strikes a chord with the rest of you out there, and hopefully we&#039;ve gotten there.<br /><br />My friend expressed concerns that the asian text made it look like many japanese box arts, which apparently tend to have a big title in roman letters and then a smaller one in japanese. I didn&#039;t really think of this, but when shown some examples I totally see that it looks similar.<br /><br />The problem with this is a complicated postmodern layer-on-layer culture kind of thing: It <i>looks </i>like the creator of the logo is trying to imitate japanese box art, but the creator is an idiot, and doesn&#039;t realize that japanese writing contains meaning. Instead he thinks it&#039;s just some sort of decoration some games have, and tries to imitate it.<br /><br />Basically it looks like I&#039;m &quot;trying to be japanese&quot; or &quot;trying too hard to be cool&quot; - and as we all know, trying hard to be cool is <i>not </i>cool. (Obviously I <i>am </i>in fact trying to be cool [I mean c&#039;mon, look at it], but if this is too obvious it doesn&#039;t work, accordingly to the <i>rules of cool</i>)&nbsp; <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" /><br /><br />Does anyone else think this is a problem? I myself recognize the problem, but I suspect it&#039;s only a problem for those of us who are culturally hyper-sensitive or whatever you&#039;d call it, and that even we may perhaps be able to look past it. Although, when it comes to the kind of people who back indie games on kickstarter, I guess cultural hyper-sensitivity is to be expected. </div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/021#419">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div><br></body>

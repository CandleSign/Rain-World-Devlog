IMHO it looks pretty good! I kind of agree with on the more detailed stuff though. the top and middle sections are nice because its just a solid clean silhouette and doesn&#039;t get in the way of the foreground stuff. the bottom background could be a bit less detailed maybe, not necessarily as rule but because the poles are such an important part of that level and need to more visually &quot;present&quot; I think. As it is now the poles kind of mix in with the background machines.<br /><br />just my 2 cents! I love the art, you know that <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0" /></div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/009.html#161">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

Instead of looking like something that&#039;s consistent enough to be meant to function in one way or another, it just looks like a clutter of small building blocks... which is exactly what it is -.-<br /><br />Yeah, the poles certainly could stand out more. The wierd thing is that in a way the level looks better and is more readable when there&#039;s no light at all, as such:<br /><br /><a href="http://oi49.tinypic.com/mn27wx.jpg" target="_blank"><table style="background-color:#b090a040; border:1px solid #ffffff; padding:5px"><td><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/LOST IMAGE.png" width="150px" alt="" border="0"/></td></table></a><a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/692deu.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/692deu.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="200" border="0" /></a><br />(Old one to the right for reference)<br /><br />because then there&#039;s only one, simple rule - darker=closer. Buuut I really do enjoy having the light fade out when the rain is approaching, and I&#039;ve put so much work into the shadow renderer already.<br /><br />Anyway, I removed some of the clutter from behind the poles, and kept it a stone wall that doesn&#039;t draw too much attention!</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/009.html#162">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

Earlier I added a little spark that flows through the shortcuts so that you at least have a chance to see them, now I&#039;ve started on another cue as well. Instead of drawing the shortcut symbols onto the level image, I&#039;ve made them separate sprites. Next up is making them blink or change color when a player is close to them, in a similar manner to items on the ground.<br /><br />The trick is that they&#039;ll change color in pairs, so that you can see which of all the exits is blinking when you get close to an entrance, and from that conclude where you&#039;ll end up.<br /><br />After this I&#039;ll move on to more important but boring stuff I figure, such as... the main menu -.-</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/009.html#164">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

This is certainly the last thing I make in it, and probably the last thing that <i>gets made</i> with it as well. It&#039;s good to be using a software that creates applications that you can be kind of sure will be possible to use even in a few years. I guess I&#039;ll have to emulate windows xp if I wanna play Rain World in ten years haha!<br /><br /><br />Contrary to the idea I have but never live up to - to have fun and interesting posts high up on new pages to draw new readers in - I will give you a dead boring update today. I know myself from following devlogs that boring updates are at least less frustrating than several days with no updates at all. <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/" target="_blank">Hrm</a>. So here you go:<br /><br /><b>Update 109</b><br />Made a system that enables player entrances to be shut off. As those of you who have been reading this somewhat regularly might know the game will contain levels that can both be reachable from an open world and opened up through a custom game kind of setup. In the open world scenario I want them to have only one entrance, while in a custom game I might want to have one entrance for every player or something like that.<br /><br />So now I can create a level with as many entrances as I want, and then shut all but one of them down from the code when loading them in the campaign. I simply make them lizard dens, because as it stands that was a good quick fix - a player entering a lizard den will be spitted out again right away. Had to make them not be counted when the lizards try to decide where to emerge, so that the same lizards will still come out of the same holes. It seems to work ok!<br /><br /></div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/009.html#168">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

It&#039;s hard though, because I don&#039;t know if I should start on the framework for the final main menu (and waste time making way for things that won&#039;t be used this time around) or if I should go for a quick fix (and waste time doing stuff that won&#039;t make it into the final game). Realistically I think I&#039;ll settle on changing the colors a little for the cascade of ugliness that&#039;s the main menu right now.<br /><br />This is however not what I&#039;m actually doing. I&#039;ve been wrestling Macromedia Director&#039;s very 90&#039;s-ish code solutions once again today. A sound can have a &quot;loop back here&quot;-marker set in it, but the point from which you <i>start </i>playing the sound can&#039;t be set behind that point. This means that my plan, to have a song start playing at a random place and once it reached the end start over from the very beginning, was a no-go. This wasn&#039;t good, as a custom game session is shorter than the average song, meaning that there would be a lot of musical material that would never be heard.<br /><br />I managed to fix it though, with a small hiccup in the looping. Maybe I&#039;ll get around to doing it differently for songs that actually start playing from the beginning, so that they won&#039;t suffer from the hiccup. Minimize the damages.<br /><br />Ah well, it&#039;s sunday, I might as well make this a long post.<br /><br />So, yesterday I made a small change to the level renderer that in turn made a small change to the level art. Very small, but I find it enjoyable.<br /><br />Here, look:<br /><br /><a href="http://oi45.tinypic.com/11kfw2w.jpg" target="_blank"><table style="background-color:#b090a040; border:1px solid #ffffff; padding:5px"><td><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/LOST IMAGE.png" width="150px" alt="" border="0"/></td></table></a><a href="http://oi46.tinypic.com/2i1mmnb.jpg" target="_blank"><table style="background-color:#b090a040; border:1px solid #ffffff; padding:5px"><td><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/LOST IMAGE.png" width="150px" alt="" border="0"/></td></table></a><br /><br />Can&#039;t spot the difference? Try putting them in different tabs and switching between them. Here they are, overlayed:<br /><br /><table style="background-color:#b090a040; border:1px solid #ffffff; padding:5px"><td><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/LOST IMAGE.png" width="150px" alt="" border="0"/></td></table><br /><br />The &quot;earthquake&quot; effect is because the second image is slightly scewed. I got tired of having everything completely straight and square, it seemed lifeless. But the problem was that I couldn&#039;t tilt or scew anything, because the game was mathematically built around a perfectly straight grid. The collision boxes of things would still be straight, even if the level was tilted. <br /><br />The solution I found was this :<br /><br /><table style="background-color:#b090a040; border:1px solid #ffffff; padding:5px"><td><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/LOST IMAGE.png" width="150px" alt="" border="0"/></td></table><br /><br />The level is rendered as 30 layers, and the objects of the game are drawn in layer 5. By having a &quot;scewing factor&quot; that increases as you move away from layer 5, but is fixed at 0 on layer 5 itself, it&#039;s possible to scew the background and foreground while keeping the actual gameplay relevant graphics in phase with their hitboxes.<br /><br />I know the effect is very slight - I want it that way. When trying stuff out I made some renderings that made your truly sea sick, like this:<br /><br /><a href="http://oi50.tinypic.com/5n8xg2.jpg" target="_blank"><table style="background-color:#b090a040; border:1px solid #ffffff; padding:5px"><td><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/LOST IMAGE.png" width="150px" alt="" border="0"/></td></table></a><br /><br />But I decided to keep it subtle. Maybe a little too subtle, now when I look at them I think I&#039;ll have a little more scewing in there after all... I&#039;ll settle on something. The point is that now everything isn&#039;t perfectly lined up, and just seeing a slight difference in angle between two things make the environments seem a little less artificial.<br /><br />I guess I&#039;m trying to strike a fine balance with the art. In one way I want it to look a little tile-ey, and not just like one big drawing made by hand. Not because I don&#039;t like hand drawn aesthetics, but because it has been done so many times before. <br /><br />On the other hand I want one specific feature of the hand drawn aesthetic - the uniting of the graphics into one single image. Tiles tend to look like... tiles, different pieces that fit more or less well together. Reality - especially when dirty and worn down - tends to blend into one in a way that correlates more closely to the hand drawing than to tiles. But the drawing has certain quirks as well, such as some lines looking different than others because the drawing tool is held in one hand and not the other.<br /><br />I want to have the cake and eat it. My goal is to create an aesthetic that looks like one unified image, but doesn&#039;t have the characteristics of the human hand. That&#039;s why I have this combination of tiles and effects going on. The tiles look technical and strict, while the effects make it look a little dirtier, and more importantly unifies it into one single image. What I want, after all, is to create images of worn down machines. I couldn&#039;t do without either the strict or the dirty.<br /><br />On top of this comes another factor - the stylization. The game is - in a way - pixel art, with everything that comes with that art direction. One of those things is tiles. At the same time the game is not strictly classical pixel art, it&#039;s a <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" target="_blank">subversion</a> of sorts. I want to play with the pixel art aesthetic, but I don&#039;t want to play it straight. This is for example why the characters are kind of looking like pixel art, but not <i>moving </i>like pixel art&nbsp; usually does. I want the same thing for the environments - something that&#039;s a wink to the classical pixel art genre, and something that&#039;s different.<br /><br />I like to think of my game as a pixel art <i>rendering </i>of a world that is not a &quot;pixel art kind of world&quot;.<br /><br />The tiles are more in line with the pixel art tradition, while the effects and the scewing are something else. It&#039;s a hard line to strike, because if I get too happy about adding stuff I might go too far in one direction or the other. This is for example why I use blur in the graphics, but use it sparesly. If I just went ahead I would lose the aesthetic I&#039;m aiming for.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, now I have another factor to fine tune in this balance act! </div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/009.html#173">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

So no, no parallax scrolling, just fixed screens. Rest assured though, my next project I&#039;ll move over to something (anything) else. </div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/009.html#174">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

It suddenly hit me that the game should probably be... playable until then. <br /><br />The original design idea was that in a custom game, if one player died, the timer would be set to something very low so that the other players would only have just enough time to get to an exit. There&#039;s a problem here, as the light fading/sounds playing/screen shaking stuff that goes on when the rain is approaching is triggered by certain key frames, and those can&#039;t be skipped - meaning I can&#039;t instantly set the timer to something very low. I think I can work around that though, in a way more or less hideous code-wise.<br /><br />Also started on the very basic frame work for a main menu.</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/009.html#177">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

I&#039;ve got it to a point I&#039;m decently happy with.<br /><br />If one player dies the other one is given just enough time to get back to a hole. This means that you <i>can </i>win even if you die, because if you had more flies than your opponent and he/she doesn&#039;t reach their hole in time, you still have the victory. It&#039;s however still a pretty huge advandage to not be the one to die first.<br /><br />If one player is dead, the game is halted immediately as the other player goes into a hole, and you don&#039;t have to wait for the rain.<br /><br />If both players go back into their holes at the same time the game is ended. I might change the requirements so that at least one player has to be dead for the game to end - sometimes you go into holes in order to escape lizards as well.<br /><br />When the rain comes all players that are outside are counted as dead - those in holes as alive.<br /><br />I still have to make it so that the game stops if one player is already in a hole and the other one dies.<br /><br /><br />On top of this I added a fun little detail - in competitive game modes a player can&#039;t go into a hole that&#039;s already occupied, you&#039;re spitted straight out again. I hope this will create some fun and frantic situations when players race for the closest hole. Some levels might even have less holes than players, then the gameplay becomes a balance of trying to hunt effectively and staying closer to the hole than your opponent.</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/009.html#179">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

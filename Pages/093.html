Details below! <br /><br /><i>Hello friends and slugcats! We present to you PS4 patch #1: Rain World v1.01<br /><br />This patch is intended to accommodate some early player feedback and polish assorted rough edges on the various game systems, etc. These were all low-hanging fruit that we think improves the player experience without taking anything away from the concept of the game. Rain World should be an existential experience: unforgiving and even occasionally unfair. But it should be the jaws of a Lizard that gets you or the terrifying Rain, not some ragdoll physics wonk or design oversight! <br /><br />This patch puts the PS4 version at parity with the current PC v1.015<br /><br />Gameplay improvements:<br />* “stuck in holes” fix - disconnected exits will no longer snag you<br />* subtle backlit slugcat in low visibility swimming situations<br />* quicker turning around in tunnels<br />* larger lung capacity while swimming<br />* nerfed the more intense waterfalls in Shoreline to prevent repeated drownings<br />* more pearls near Scav tolls in Garbage Wastes<br />* more food in central Garbage Wastes<br />* more food in central Shaded Citadel<br />* more karma flowers in world<br />* karma gate requirements on the Shaded Citadel, Drainage System and Underhang side were lowered to prevent players becoming stuck in challenging regions<br />* food / karma flowers regeneration now ticks forward on deaths (helps eliminate stuck / starvation situations at low karma)<br />* players will now keep map progress between deaths (Id say 99.5% of people asked for this)<br />* map now features gate karma symbols and shelter icons when locations are discovered<br />* karma depletion on game exit removed if done within 30 seconds of sleep cycle<br />* full karma drop on exit bug fixed (that was a brutal one, sheesh!)<br />* intro cinematic is now skippable<br />* upon respawn after death, shelter doors cycle through opening animation faster<br />* many many minor room fixes<br /><br />Stability improvements:<br />* Save file corruption fixed<br />* map loading bug fixed<br />* gate crashing bug fixed, as well as multiple other rare crashing bugs<br />* assorted additional stability improvements<br /><br />Thanks for your patience!! <br />--RW Devs</i></div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/093#1844">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

My intention with these guys is that they&#039;ll be used to make life difficult for Red slugcat, but it&#039;s James who places creatures in the world so we&#039;ll see what happens. In either case, I think they have a lot of potential to be fun in multiplayer.<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/DefinitiveIndolentAmericanrobin.gif" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />Jumping hasn&#039;t really been a thing for rain world creatures so far, because I couldn&#039;t sort it out with the path finding. Basically, once you open the pandoras box of jumping, pretty much every tile on the level is connected to pretty much every other, through the means of these really complicated parabolas. Was quite difficult to find a solution for that in terms of path finding.<br /><br />My work around was this: From where the creature is, I follow its pathfinder around 5 or so tiles forward. This is a spot the creature can be expected to be in in about a second. At this position I plop down a &quot;jump finder&quot;, which at a high frequency tries a bunch of random jump directions and velocities and traces out those parabolas with super simple physics.<br /><br />It also keeps track of its &quot;best jump so far&quot;. Every time it has a successful parabola (landing on actual terrain etc) it checks that landing spot against the &quot;best so far&quot;. If the path finding weight is lower (closer to destination), this is the new best. Because it&#039;s very quick, it will pretty soon find some decent jump proposals.<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/HonestZestyDikkops.gif" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />Once the lizard reaches the jump finder, it checks whether the current best jump of that jump finder is valid and worth it (does it actually take me closer to my destination? Is it a reasonable jump arc and not a super high and narrow one that will bring me 3 tiles forward but take me on a 6 second rocket launch into the sky?). If so, it jumps!<br /><br />When jumping it places a new jump finder on the expected landing location, which will be working during the air-time. With a bit of luck it will have found a new nice jump to be chained on immediately when landing.<br /><br />Some more gifs!<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/SpecificBarrenDanishswedishfarmdog.gif" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/DistinctHonoredKagu.gif" alt="" border="0" /></div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/093#1847">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

There are currently people who want to see the game but are unable to progress through it, which is a shame, so yellow will be a little milder in a bunch of ways.<br />Red - hardcore mode for hardcore players.

The dropwig is supposed to keep you always on your toes and never quite able to relax - every room is a potential danger and you need to be on your best game always!<br /><br />The drop itself is supposed to be somewhat dangerous but avoidable with good reflexes. Once the dropwig is mobilized though, you have a quite dangerous predator on the floor next to you, and a situation that needs to be dealt with quickly. Although if you&#039;re playing Red it&#039;s assumed you&#039;re a pretty good spear thrower, and it shouldn&#039;t be too difficult to fight it off.<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/WelltodoNeedyFlounder.gif" alt="" border="0" /></div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/093#1849">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

I&#039;ve been adding creatures (some of which not announced) and it&#039;s a pretty good number now actually! Depending on how generous your definition, there are either 5 (with the most conservative definition) or 8 (if you&#039;re more forgiving and for example count adult needle worm and baby needle worm separately ~ which would make sense to do if you consider the lizard colors &quot;different creatures&quot; I think!) new creatures coming up, and a ton of other stuff as well, including the multiplayer/arena mode and the different playable slugcats. So I think the update will be pretty good!

I certainly dont want all to be accessible from yellow and were not going to change the overall experience of white too much, but i think it would be cool that the knowledge one gains of the new creatures when playing through yellow and white would give you a big advantage experience-wise when going into red. if that all makes sense!<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1339480#msg1339480">Quote from: JLJac on June 13, 2017, 12:41:33 AM</a></div><div class="quote"><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=25183.msg1339342#msg1339342">Quote from: Dinomaniak on June 12, 2017, 03:47:59 AM</a></div><div class="quote">I&#039;m very curious on the dropwig interaction with other creatures, like a white lizard or a bird, or even the nightmarish jump-crawler creature two pages ago.<br /></div>Me too!

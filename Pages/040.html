I&#039;ve not done any graphical work on it what so ever though - as some of you might remember the white lizard is supposed to have a quite unique look too it - but here it&#039;s just like the others but with a white head. Don&#039;t look at that, look at the tounge <img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Smileys/tongue.gif" alt="Tongue" border="0" /><br /><br />In the game it&#039;s just represented as a point lashing out, but the graphical module for the lizard improvises some rope physics-ish stuff on top of that, with the triangle mesh code from the tail. The tongue gets slimmer if stretched, and is allowed to curl up a bit when very relaxed. As it&#039;s spit out each point along it is given a slightly random vector, making it initially come out curled up as a package, to then later straighten out. I&#039;m very happy with this effect, it looks &quot;nature documentary&quot; as James put it, and a little organic and weird. Good times!<br /><br />What&#039;s worse is the actual gameplay implementation. Lizards are a bit less good at biting you now compared to the lingo build - they used to pretty much be &quot;kill on touch&quot;, but now they have to have a more reasonable position to get a bite in. It seems that when dragging you in with the tongue, they generally don&#039;t tend to get that position in order, meaning that it&#039;s quite easy to get away in the time between the tongue releasing you and the jaws actually biting you - as you can see in the top gif.<br /><br />I could make it so that they automatically get a grip of you if they&#039;ve caught you with the tongue, but I like that you&#039;re not necessarily 100% doomed once they get you. It should be a serious situation though, so maybe they&#039;ll get a little bonus in their bite check right after releasing a tongue grip, or something similar. You shouldn&#039;t be able to count on getting away.<br /><br />If they miss you and hit a wall, there&#039;s a chance they&#039;ll get stuck there, which looks kind of fun. Each frame has a certain random chance that they&#039;ll get loose again, so they could be there for no time at all, or quite a while.<br /><br />The blue lizard also has a tongue, but much shorter and less effective. While the white lizard will stay still once it got you, and try to reel you in slowly, the blue lizard (which is not considerably heavier than you) will rather use the tongue to let itself be dragged after you, which is almost more annoying because it gives you less time to think. However, the blue lizard doesn&#039;t use the tongue quite as much, and will miss you most of the time it tries.</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/040#781">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

That&#039;s some harmonious compositions right there!<br /><br />@DarkWanderer, yeah, I could very easily put up a system that keeps track of &quot;annoyance&quot; with other creatures, and as accidental damage happens between them those numbers would be incremented. The tracker would be hooked up to the utility comparer, and when the annoyance with another creature got too bad it&#039;d flip to an aggressive behavior (given that there&#039;s nothing more important to do, such as fleeing). The attack would in turn cause annoyance in the other creature, and there&#039;d be a fight! Weighting in how scary the other creature is definitely doable as well~<br /><br /><b>Update 339</b><br />Spears, spears, spears. A loooot of trigonometry going on today, with how the spears are supposed to get stuck in a certain angle, and then keep that angle as the creature is rotating.<br /><br />Also, gluing one object to another in a way that didn&#039;t render them apart when moving at high velocities demanded a pretty deep dive in the game engine. What had to be done was separating updates of graphical modules, putting it after the game object updates, and also pass down a parameter to all objects so they could be asked by other objects whether or not they had been updated this frame. And a lot of other stuff, haha. But now one object can be glued to another, and it will stick snugly to the right coordinate even if everything is moving at a high velocity.<br /><br />Further spear stuff completed today includes ability to stick spears in walls, and lizards having their spear-reflective heads implemented to much annoyance when play testing. Nailing lizards to walls is also in, I had fun this morning dodging around a courtyard as a poor white lizard sat impaled on a wall and tried to hit me with its tongue. What&#039;s new from the lingo version is the ability of spears to hit decorative body parts, such as the limbs or head in the case of the lizard. The spear doesn&#039;t really hit those parts, but the chunk they&#039;re attached to - but it gets it rotation and a bit of its placement from the decorative body part, making it look as if it&#039;s stuck there. With lizard legs I also implemented the disabling of limbs from a while ago when they get hit by spears - it looks pretty tragic, but also pretty cool. <br /><br />The actual spears still look like red sticks though, so you&#039;ll get to see them later!</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/040#788">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

But yeah, they&#039;re constantly re-evaluating their targets, so they could easily do a shift like that.<br /><br /><b>Update 340</b><br />Yesterday I did all the fun stuff with spears, today I proceeded to get the boring stuff done! Such as having them disappear with creatures into short cuts, and then reappear (not duplicated!) and so on and so forth.<br /><br />This in turn forced me to get to some other interesting stuff. I set up a &quot;health state&quot; class for creatures keeping track of their health, and what spears they have stuck in them (yes, I know this is macabre, but it has to be coded haha!). In order to keep track of what spear is where, I implemented an ID system, which also applies to creatures. It&#039;s really simple, every single object in the game (which is an actual interactive object, I don&#039;t label water drips and sparks) has a unique integer ID. This is accomplished really easily by having an integer in the main game class, and each time an object is created it asks to be assigned an ID, and the integer increases. No two objects will ever have the same ID! The upper limit for an int is more than two thousand million, so you&#039;d have to eat a lot of bats for it to run out. <br /><br />Unique ID&#039;s are cool for a few reasons! First of all, purely technical stuff, such as when spawning a spear, the game can look through a list of displaced spears &quot;is this particular spear actually somewhere else&quot; and if it&#039;s displaced, refrain from spawning it. That way object consistency can be created - one object exists in one place, and one place only.<br /><br />But it&#039;s with creatures that the possibilities get really interesting! Just off the top of my head - relationships between individuals could be saved. &quot;I&#039;m very scared of creature #6911!&quot; Or, and this one I know will make James happy, the ID can be used as a random seed for individual variations, cosmetic or behavioral. These would probably have to be pretty clearly communicated for them to be noticed, but they could be cool even if they&#039;re subtle, just knowing that the creatures are in fact individuals would perhaps making your interactions with them feel more personal.<br /><br />Last for the day, I made a James friendly build so he can try out his level editor work! It seems to be running nicely, but some of the levels are not loading, so we&#039;ll have to troubleshoot that. All in all, a good week! Thanks for hanging around and talking, see you guys Monday!</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/040#793">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

So many ideas! I do like the fungus idea, but it seems like that is a mechanic that should be a game itself, rather than something you slap on top of a finished concept. Haha and as Jimbert points out, Halo Did It! But if you had a game that was more focused on containing (or spreading) the contamination and built mechanics around that, it&#039;d be really cool.<br /><br /><b>Update 341</b><br />Gggaaaaaaahhhhh shaaaaader heeeell revisited! <br /><br />The coloration is obviously not the real deal (just gave it some colors that made it easy to see, won&#039;t use gradients when in the final look), but I&#039;m happy with the surface movement and how it exists in the 3D-environment.

There HAS to be some way around it though, they can&#039;t reasonably expect people to write fragment shaders without being able to ask about what pixel on the screen is being handled -___-). And even more funny, I wrote the entire thing imagining that it was snugly lined up to the level pixels, but when I resized the unity window - everything was suddenly fifty pixels to the left of where it should be! I had built it dependent on my unity window size... Well, the two problems are pretty much just one actually - getting screen coordinates (of the game area, not the goddamn Unity editor) and I feel pretty confident there has to be some solution for that.

James and I are discussing this from a game design perspective as well. However, diving is turning out to be so much fun that I think it&#039;ll just have to be in the game... But maybe in a limited way - like, you can dive down, but you&#039;ll have to be skillful about it or you&#039;ll drown very easily. It all needs to make sense with the &quot;rain kills you&quot; theme as well, if the slugcat is perfectly comfortable under water that whole thing seems a little less viable. But, all those questions aside, the simple aspect of controlling the slugcat in the water is turning out pretty good! I&#039;ll gif you when I have some bubbles.<br /><br />Also, the shaders keep messing with me -.- Sometimes when I open the editor, they work, sometimes not. Now it&#039;s <br />&#039;variable/member &quot;scrPos&quot; has semantic &quot;WPOS&quot; which is not visible in this profile;&#039;<br />does anyone have any idea how you make something &quot;visible in the profile&quot;?</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/040#798">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div>

Jusst so Joar doesn&#039;t have to go back through and answer all of them:<br /><br />* Yes, the concept is that rain kills by battery, pummeling and smothering anything that gets in its way (like a huge natural power sprayer is kind of the idea), but its def true that does seem to not be terribly extreme since the game playing audience is used to &quot;acid poison lava void levels&quot; sort of thing. So we&#039;ll need to make sure the threatening &quot;water = dangerous&quot; theme is carried through to this new traversable form to. <br /><br />One thing is that you will often encounter light rains in the game as a warning, building up very obviously to the deadly downpour, so we are thinking of keeping that same mechanic with the water: safe when relatively calm, but then can build to deadly rough waves and storm when the Death Rains come, before being pummeled AND drowned.<br /><br />* as for the another world style tentacles, prettttty much? unless we want CRAZY feature creep, we&#039;ll want to have a &quot;reason&quot; to limit the scope of what the cat can do in the water to a fairly shallow reach (for now at least), so we&#039;ve talked about having some SCARY WEIRD SEA THINGS lurking down there to do just that. There have been a few loosely defined water region creatures in our &quot;design document&quot; (LOL) for a while, but this will be more of an elemental, unspecified thing im guessing. Unknown things moving around deep under the sea is probably the scariest thing ever, so I feel like this will be amazing for mood. Joar&#039;s water distortion effect already terrifies me, so im SUPER looking forward to seeing what he can do with this.<br /><br />Im SO excited that the water regions are working out. You dont even know. It&#039;s been something we&#039;ve been talking about for a long while, and from my perspective its necessary to complete the rain cycle motif. It ties into a few other things which are now possible because of this, like a puzzle piece being put into place. Got big plans for this!</div><div class="messagelink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/040#799">[Message link]</a></div></div><div class="sidebar"></div></div><br></body>

First up, pop corn!<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/OnlyMadeupEider.gif" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />These &quot;seed cobs&quot; require a spear to open. Once you&#039;ve opened one, you can eat your fill from it - it allows you to max out your food meter. However, once opened it will go stale (like the other two in the gif) for <i>many</i> cycles, I have the default set to 7-10, but it&#039;s tweakable on James&#039; end. <br /><br />The idea is that these are sort of a limited resource where you have to make some interesting decisions - you can get free food, and all you need, now - but then you won&#039;t have it for later. So coming across one of these you&#039;ll have to ask yourself if you REALLY need it right now. <br /><br />The ideal tactic I imagine is to be using them mainly when moving between regions. It has previously been sort of a problem that you manage to collect enough &quot;karma&quot; to pass into a neighboring region, but once through the gate you starve because you don&#039;t know where the food is in the uncharted territory. The alternative is to get some food in your starting region and then move out - but then the time pressure can be really rough. So with these, you&#039;ll be able to scope one out but save it until you&#039;re doing your rush for another region - then you can fill up before moving out, giving you a bit of a softer start in the next region.</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/083.html#1641">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

These guys are originally hard little seeds, that can in fact be used as rocks for throwing at enemies, and are completely inedible. If you dip them in water though, they become a delicious frog egg kind of watery blob.<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/AbleDangerousChamois.gif" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />How much of a pain getting them to water will be, is completely up to James over in level design department. Sometimes they might grow very close to water, making it easy to just plop them in and enjoy. Other times, it might be a long haul where you have to ask yourself whether it&#039;s worth it to bring them with you, as they do occupy your paws that could otherwise be used for carrying spears or catching bats.</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/083.html#1642">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

I did want to add something to make them a little bit more exciting though, so they do have sticky tentacles. The tentacles don&#039;t stick on every collision, but swimming through them there&#039;s a small chance to get tangled. If that happens, the jellyfish acts as a buoy making it harder to dive down, which might be a slight annoyance. After being stuck for a little while the jellyfish will stun you momentarily and then let you go. It&#039;s easy to get away though - just get out of the water, or even just do a swim-jump up above the surface.

I usually try to gauge a person&#039;s interest first and give a series of shorter answers that work by themselves, but also can be stacked up and elaborated on if the person seems like they are willing to go deep into it. <br /><br />this article isnt entirely accurate with some of the details (i was either misquoted a few times or *really* tired for whatever interview it was taken from), but is also kind of spot on in how it presents the game. details or not, the author totally gets it, and thats pretty encouraging: <a href="http://www.gamesradar.com/rain-world-wants-you-to-feel-bad-for-killing-its-hungry-enemies/" target="_blank">http://www.gamesradar.com/rain-world-wants-you-to-feel-bad-for-killing-its-hungry-enemies/</a></div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/083.html#1648">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

The scavenger lantern:<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/giphy3.gif" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />(The graphic of the actual lantern might change a bit, I&#039;m reusing another sprite atm which I&#039;m not 100% happy with)<br /><br />The scav lanterns are very valuable in Shadow Urban, as they are strong, reliant light sources that can be carried in one hand and don&#039;t struggle/flee like the Lantern Mice.<br /><br />Scavenger fire spear:<br /><br /><img src="/Rain-World-Devlog/Images/Archived Images/giphy4.gif" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />The fire spear is a spear with a fabric around the top, apparently containing some powder of some sort. These are terrifying when being used against you, but can also be a valuable resource as they&#039;re a very powerful offence. The sneaky game design trick here is that while they appear super terrifying when used against you, they don&#039;t actually make the game much harder, as you die from just a normal spear already. Contrary, scavengers attacking you with these might provide a small benefit as that gives you the chance to get your hands on one.<br /><br />As you might notice, these items are basically purely better versions of already existing items. The idea with that is not to ruin the balance of the game, but to provide a reason for interacting with scavengers. Scavs are the only source of these goodies, and in order to get your hands on them you&#039;ll need to either trade with, be friends with or fight the scavengers, each with their corresponding consequences. <br /><br /></div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/083.html#1649">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>

I&#039;m sure it is the furthest thing from your minds now you are on the home stretch but I wondered in a related and roundabout way how moddable the game would be?

We&#039;d likely need an equal amount of time to develop that for public use as the game itself! Also, since the game world has become so huge and factoring in the eventual multiplayer rooms and all of that... i feel like the last thing people are going to want is *more* maps, lol.

I think if we firmly establish it that &quot;in this region you fall down&quot; and add some visual indication, might be clear enough.</div><div style="font-size:80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/Rain-World-Devlog/Pages/083.html#1659">[Message link]</a></div></div><div style="flex-basis:10%"></div></div>
